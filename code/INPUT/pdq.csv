Argentina,"The governance of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy in Argentina is grounded in historical processes of emergence and institutionalization of STI developments in a federal country, mostly funded by the public sector. 

Pillar institutions were created in the late 50s, including the National Council on Science and Technology (CONICET) and its Scientific Technological Centers (CCTs) that span all over the country, the National Commission of Atomic Energy (CNEA), the National Institute for Agricultural Technology (INTA) and the National Institute for Industrial Technology (INTI). Also at this time, national universities set up full time positions for scholars devoted essentially to basic research. 

In 1958 and under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, the Secretary of Science and Technology (SICYT, Secretaría de Innovación, Ciencia y Tecnología) was created as the main governmental entity devoted to promote national policies in S&T. Public bodies in other Ministries were established under a mission-oriented approach to encourage applied research and technology development in Health, Mining, Agriculture, Energy, Foreign Affairs and Defense. 

In 1996, the National Agency for the Promotion of Science and Technology (ANPCYT) emerged as a decentralized body with two funding instruments: the Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONCyT) and the Argentine Technological Fund (FONTAR) -a decade later, the Fund for the Promotion of Software Industry (FONSOFT) and the Sectorial Argentine Fund (FONARSEC) were also incorporated. 

In 2007, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation (MINCYT, former SICYT) was created. It was conceived as the main responsible political body for the governance of the STI national system, which comprises not only political advisory bodies, legislative commissions, universities, and organisms, at national, provincial and municipal level, but also any other entity that aims to carry out essential activities linked to science, technological development, innovation, and capacity building of human resources. 

As stated by its foundational Act (Law 25.467), one of MINCYT´s main duties is to promote and guide R&D in strategic areas by establishing a National STI Plan. To encourage synergies at national and provincial levels in priority fields set by the STI plan, three key structures were established under the MINCYT: 
1) 	the Scientific Technological Cabinet (GACTEC), chaired by the head of the Cabinet of Ministers, which constitutes an inter-ministerial and interdisciplinary setting that also channels interaction with both Congress chambers, articulating consultations, exchanging information, discussing resource allocation; 
2) 	the Inter-institutional Council on Science and Technology (CICYT), coordinated by the Secretary of Scientific Technological Articulation (SACT), in which all relevant actors of the STI national system are being represented; and 
3) 	the Federal Council on Science and Technology (COFECYT), aims to promote regional policies with special focus on less-favoured provinces for a harmonious development of the country. Links with private sector are encouraged by ANPCYT´s funding instruments (see above), as well as CONICET´s Network of Technological Transfer Offices, and universities´ Units of Technological Transfer (UVTs) devoted to provide technical assistance on project management and the commercialisation of research.","The following topics framed most recent debates on national R&D policies:

-	The priority setting mechanisms of the current National STI Plan “Argentina Innovadora 2020” to enrich diagnosis and contents of the “Argentina Innovadora 2030” follow-up proposal, as well as prioritisation for sub-national STI policies, regional and sectorial programmes and inter-ministerial initiatives.

-	The amount and distribution of federal budget for STI development, with particular focus on strengthening capabilities of less-favoured regions, and special concern on satisfying specific social demands to insure that public funded research contributes to a harmonious wellbeing. 

-	The profile, performance and federal distribution of human resources of the scientific community (researchers, technologists, innovators, entrepreneurs, science administrators) and how these meet the needs and interests of CONICET, universities and R&D centers where these actors perform.

-	Improving institutional evaluations and resources and tools for the accountability of publicly funded projects. 

-	Boosting open science and transparency by facilitating access to (i) primary research data; (ii) open access publications; (iii) statistical visualizations; (iv) funded projects; (v) researchers curricula; and, (vi) online applications for scientists, entrepreneurs, technicians, journalists and governmental actors.

-	Develop new instruments to support business involvement in STI novel supplies, by connecting researchers, technologists, professionals, organizations and companies with venture capital interested in supporting and financing scientific projects, innovations and novel products.","The overall context for the Argentinian SMEs and entrepreneurs and their international expansion has been favoured by efforts done by the current government to bring macroeconomic stability, decrease inflation -towards reaching the one digit goal in 2019- and to institutionalize frameworks to guarantee a sustainable growth.. 

Legal instruments and financial tools have recently received particular attention, such as seed funds, loans, tax exemptions for innovation, public-private co-investment programs, crowdfunding platforms, and venture capital for technological and scientific-based accelerators. Though recently created, the Trust Fund for the Development of Entrepreneur Capital (FONDCE), the Simplified Stock Company (SAS) and the Collective Financing System are also expected to encourage the expansion of the entrepreneurial capital industry.","As in other countries, there are two main concerns that structure current debates: 
1)	the increased speed of transition to a globalized and highly competitive knowledge-based economy, which also means shorter product cycles and hence shorter time horizons for private sector to invest in R&D; and 
2)	budgetary constraints faced by governments and their impact on the funding of university research, in a context in which research and development costs are higher. 

To addresss these challenges MINCYT developed Innovation Argentina (http://www.innovacionargentina.gob.ar/), a web platform that that seeks to enhance synergies between relevant actors of the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation and the private sector, by exchanging ideas, information and available resources in relation to their capabilities and needs of technological innovation. This Project was strategically designed in four main courses of action: 
1)	the Platform for Demands and Technological Transfer (PDTT), a network of institutions from the academic, scientific-technological, governmental and business sector, which carry out a survey of innovation demands and publish those demands online to increase visibility and generate a prompt response; 
2)	the Support to the Productive Sector (ASEP), that provides guidance and assistance on available financing tools for entrepreneurship, applied research and the addition of value to the national production; 
3)	the Strengthening Program for Technology Transfer Offices (OVTT), aiming to back these interface units that facilitate the interaction between the generation of knowledge and its application, providing guidance on project management, financing tools and intellectual property rights; 
4)	the Support Program for the Study of Technological Demands (PAR), which seeks to develop the work of human resources highly specialized in technology transfer, particularly their efforts to generate future projects that will contribute to meeting demands disclosed by the PDTT.","In Argentina, the growth of research is uneven in the different areas of knowledge and geographical regions. Moreover, fundamental research has traditionally not been oriented around specific priorities, though there have been attempts in the past to change this tradition. Nowadays, the main debates around the STI human resources system and relevant policies refer to the balance between free vs problem-oriented research, to the improvement of mechanisms for technology transfer and to the evaluation of the performance of researchers. All of these show that it is necessary to encourage and reinforce a virtuous link between the production of knowledge and its applications.
In the past fifteen years, some public scientific research institutions have had important staff increases. However, this has not been accomplished within the framework of medium- and long-term perspectives for the STI system and the development of some disciplines has been prioritised. Particularly, it is important to point out concern in the case of some public technological research institutions or some universities where there are shortages of researchers or ageing staff and replacement after retirement has not been properly foreseen.","Social Innovation is essential in generating positive proposals for progress and cohesion that face the greater economic, political and cultural challenges brought by the current socioeconomic context. 
Promoting Social Innovation requires revising some paradigms in the design of public policies, as well as identifying and articulating participation channels. Through these, citizens can take an active role in generating new perspectives, methods and tools that provide solutions together with public and private institutions, entrepreneurs and creators of business networks and non-governmental organisations. 
Social Innovation is, therefore, at the centre of the debate on renewing spaces for socio-economic development. The search for public consensus in the design of the measures to adopt is of particular importance for systematising the strengths and weaknesses of the situation.",
Australia,"The debate around national science, technology and innovation (STI) policy governance has focused on the need for increasingly strategic and co-ordinated approaches to ensure that effort is focused on achieving national priorities. In Australia, government science and research activities follow a hybrid model, with responsibilities distributed across government and located where most relevant. Hence, maintaining strategic direction requires good co-ordination.

The Australian Government will continue to drive STI policy systematically and strategically, informed by the latest evidence and in areas of national priority. Aligning Commonwealth, state and territory initiatives is a significant issue in this regard. Under the aegis of the Council of Australian Government, the Industry and Skills Council has agreed on a set of common objectives to guide a nationally consistent approach. Initiatives such as the National Innovation and Science Agenda; the National Science and Technology Council; Innovation and Science Australia; the National Science Statement; and the National Science and Research Priorities have been developed or implemented to provide strategic guidance on STI policy governance.","Australia’s public research sector is known for its capacity to attract excellent international researchers and students to our universities, bringing spill over effects to the national economy. 

Australia has a high quality research system and performs strongly against most measures of achievement. Despite accounting for only 0.3 per cent of the world's population, we produce more than 3 per cent of research publications (2015) and around 12.6% per cent of the top 10% of highly cited publications (2015). However, collaboration between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and researchers is low by OECD standards, with 2.7 per cent of SMEs collaborating with higher education or public research institutions in 2012-14.

There is interest in investigating the ways businesses and higher education sectors can better work together. Australia continues to be focused on approaches to better support research collaboration, the translation of research into social and economic benefits, as well as supporting high-quality basic research, driving efforts to improve research engagement and impact. Another area of focus is the need for Australia’s research-training system to better equip students with transferable skills, thereby ensuring their ability to apply their knowledge in the workforce.

Australia is investing in national research infrastructures and open data platforms to coordinate and integrate research domains across the country. The 2018 Research Infrastructure Investment Plan, based on an earlier National Research Infrastructure Roadmap, has informed planning and investment into platforms necessary for collaborative research in a variety of fields including high performance computing, health sciences, and earth and environmental systems. Data-based research infrastructure built through this initiative seek to meet a range of needs, such as coordination for state and national research efforts, as well as provide an interface for academia, private enterprise and international researchers. Ongoing scoping is being conducted into how to efficiently prioritise future research infrastructure investments as the sector continues to evolve digitally and thematically.","Public investment in the innovation system must provide economic and social dividends through increased job opportunities and economic growth. Spurring innovation is a major factor in improving productivity and an important policy objective for the Australian Government. It is particularly important in the current economic environment, characterised by fiscal constraints and low interest rates. Business innovation improves business performance, including internal competitiveness: the more novel and frequent the innovations, the greater their impact on business performance. 

A major focus of the debate on innovation policy has been how to allocate government resources most efficiently among targeted innovation initiatives. 

Another key issue pertains to how the Australian Government can best embed a culture of innovation in Australian business. This debate has focused on the following elements:
-	Ensuring greater collaboration between industry and the research sector (including discussions on realigning incentive structures for both sectors).
-	Enacting regulatory changes to counter a culture of risk aversion, while preserving incentives for investors.
-	Establishing mechanisms to enable businesses to access the skills they need to remain competitive.

Further policy debates around government support to business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship involve how best to encourage business investment in research and development activities and how government procurement can be used to support and incentivise innovation.","Over the past two years, the government has maintained a strong focus on the knowledge-transfer system and considerations on how to raise the level of business expenditure in research and development (BERD) are becoming increasingly prominent. 

The Australian Government supports knowledge transfer between the publicly funded research sector and business through a variety of programs. Some programs are large and have been in place for many years, e.g. the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program, the Rural R&D Corporations, the Australian Research Council (ARC) Industrial Transformation Research Program, as well as activities undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRIO). Other programs, such as the Innovation Connections element of the Entrepreneurs’ Programme, are small in comparison but proving to deliver valuable outcomes in bridging the gap between university researchers and small and medium businesses. Another key government policy is the Industry Growth Centres Initiative. A main objective of the Initiative is to improve engagement and linkages between research and industry, as well as within industry, to achieve stronger commercialisation outcomes in Australia’s key sectors. 

The most significant changes to government policy on research-industry linkages have pertained to universities. The Australian Government provides substantial support to universities through block-grant funding. In recent years, it has increased the degree to which it allocates this funding based on the income universities receive from industry. These changes in incentive structures have started delivering real results, with universities more conscious of their need to engage with industry participants to successfully translate their research.","Recent years have seen competing narratives concerning the oversupply of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduates on the one hand, and skill shortages in some STEM areas (particularly engineering and information technology) on the other. This debate is partly driven by the mismatch between the skills taught in tertiary education and the skills required by industry. While university enrolment in STEM fields has grown steadily over the past decade (with the natural and physical sciences registering the strongest growth), it has remained stable as a share of total enrolments. Some see the large numbers of science graduates working outside of research as evidence of oversupply. Others see it as evidence of the broad applicability of scientific training, particularly in innovative industries and firms.
There has been growing recognition of the needs to: (i) integrate STEM skills with non-STEM skills (e.g. in business and entrepreneurship, and more broadly, the humanities and social sciences); and, (ii) to develop more flexible pathways between academia and industry to support innovative activities.
Noting the need to transition to an increasingly knowledge-based economy, the Australian Government recognises the importance of a highly skilled, STEM literate workforce. To help facilitate this, the Australian Government has a suite of initiatives to increase opportunities for students to engage with STEM. For example, the government supports students to participate in the International Science and Mathematics Olympiads. 
In addition, the Australian Government is also taking steps to ensure the full potential of the workforce is realised. The government is seeking to address STEM gender equity issues by investing in initiatives to increase participation of women and girls in STEM including the Advancing Women in STEM Strategy and the expansion of the Science in Australia Gender Equity (SAGE) program.","The Australian Government is committed to promoting a prosperous, dynamic and fair Australia, featuring globally competitive businesses, well-paid jobs and high living standards. Innovation through research and development, and technology transfer and adoption are key to delivering these outcomes and are important drivers of productivity and economic growth, which in turn provides a means to improve social and environmental outcomes for all Australians. The government continues to investigate ways to improve Australia’s innovation system, to create an environment that fosters a culture of innovation among researchers, businesses and workers, and throughout the country’s communities, including in regional and rural areas. 

A key debate in innovation policy has focused on finding an appropriate balance between translational and applied research, and other activities (e.g. basic research) that do not present obvious applications, but generate new knowledge that may lead to positive spillovers. In recent years, the government’s targeted innovation policies have focused on further translating Australia’s research into commercial outcomes. However, the government continues to recognise the importance of basic research, as well as pursuing long-term strategic opportunities in both established and emerging industries.

Discussions have also highlighted that disruption caused by innovation may have adverse effects on certain individual and communities, e.g. by displacing existing jobs and challenging the viability of existing businesses. The debate around Australia’s innovation policy, therefore, has increasingly focused on leveraging innovation to help Australian workers and businesses respond to change (e.g. through education and training), in order to maintain or improve living standards for all Australians, including in the regions.

A broad and sustained support base is required to pursue ambitious initiatives and so is a willingness to embrace risk and weather some failures along the way in pursuit of societal and environmental goals. A further policy debate is how best to direct investment and achieve the scale and focus required to tackle national or global challenges. High-impact national projects such as “national missions”, can harness the power of a country’s science, technology and innovation (STI) and entrepreneurial talent towards addressing societal challenges. The potential to implement a missions-based approach to policy to address societal challenges is being considered by the Australian Government.",
Austria,"In its RTI strategy 2020, adopted in 2011, the Austrian Government set itself the goal of leading Austria into the group of European Innovation leaders with a view to sustainably secure and develop employment and prosperity. In order to achieve this goal, in August 2018 the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research, the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology and the Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs developed a Future Initiative for Research, Technology and Innovation in Austria, which has the following components:

New RTI strategy until 2030
Based on the principles of excellence and competition as well as impact and openness, a new RTI strategy until 2030 will be developed. Among other input, it will refer to the results of the OECD Review on Innovation Policy, which has been submitted in December 2018. The high-level working group “Task Force RTI” has been commissioned by the Council of Ministers to prepare a process and timetable for the new RTI strategy, which will be finalised in 2020. 

Five thematic working groups have been established:
-	Research Infrastructures
-	Human Resources
-	Internationalization
-	EU-Missions and EU-Partnerships
-	Applied Research and Impact on Economy and Society
Excellence Initiative for top-level research in the field of basic research

Following a recommendation of the OECD review of innovation policy in Austria, the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research will create an ""Excellence Initiative"" for top-level research in the field of basic research. This Excellence Initiative will be part of the new RTI strategy 2030.

Research Financing Act 
In order to ensure long-term, strategic planning of research funding, to make the governance of the Austrian research and innovation system more efficient and to achieve the continuous increase in public and private research expenditure aimed at achieving the 3.76% target, a research financing act is required. This is intended to:
-	Set a legally qualified – if not binding – goal to increase RTI budgets.
-	Make RTI budgets available for a revolving three years’ period. The present system allows only for one year while the four years’ budgetary framework is only indicative.
-	Provide for three years’ performance contracts with the key research performing and funding organisations. There is a number of technical issues at present leading to a very fragmented system of short term contracts.
Towards this purpose, in August 2018 the Council of Ministers mandated the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, in agreement with the other ministries represented in the high-level working group “Task Force RTI”, to develop a Research Financing Act including a Pact for Research. Accordingly, a bill has been put forward in September 2019 and is now under review. After the 2019 general elections, the incoming government will have to present a respective proposal to parliament. 

Merger of existing advisory bodies (RTI)
The OECD review of innovation policy in Austria recommended the establishment of a single Science, Research and Innovation Council. Therefore the Austrian Federal Government hast stated in its new programme that it is examining a merger of the two existing councils, the Austrian Council for Research and Technology Development (RFTE) and the Austrian Science Board (ÖWR), possibly only with a view to improving cooperation, supplemented by economic expertise. The mandate of the ERA Council Forum Austria expired in 2019.

Research funding database 
Under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of Finance, a project team was appointed with the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of a research-funding database. This also responds to a request made by the Court of Audit in its report on research funding in Austria, published on 24 June 2016. The research funding database is a major contribution to making the research funding system even more transparent, efficient and accurate.","According to Statistics Austria, an estimated € 12.8 billion was spent on Austrian research and development (R&D) in 2019. Thus, the projected total sum of Austrian R&D spending rose by 4.5% compared to 2018, reaching 3.19% of gross domestic product (GDP). This would place Austria above the European target value of 3% for the sixth consecutive year. In the past ten years 2009 – 2019, R&D Investments increased nominally by 71.1%, but gross domestic product only by 39.1% - the growth in R&D Investment has therefore exceeded economic growth, confirming that the Austrian economy is becoming increasingly research intensive.

In quantitative terms, the private business sector accounts for the largest share of R&D spending (49%, or approximately EUR 6.3 billion). This share rises to 64.5% of R&D spending when adding the funds provided by enterprises outside Austria. Thus, Austria is steadily approaching the distribution target for research funding (two-thirds from the private sector, one-third from the public sector) defined in the Austrian Strategy for Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) 2020. 

While R&D intensity is an important indicator, it reveals little about the quality of output and structural change. Austria is therefore interested in further developing existing indicators (e.g. European Innovation Scoreboard) in order to be able to map new developments and challenges. This should enable better evidence-based policies.

Finally, all parts of the Future Initiative for Research, Technology and Innovation (i.e. the new RTI strategy until 2030), the Excellence Initiative for top-level basic research, the Research Financing Act, the merger of three existing advisory bodies (RTI), and the research funding database) aim at supporting and improving Austria’s public research system.","Governmental assistance and support of businesses has been flourishing within the last decades. The Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) and the Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW) have developed numerous research funding programmes, such as COMET and Christian Doppler Laboratories, to mention just a few. Furthermore, the research premium, which in 2018 has risen to 14%, is an important incentive for national and international businesses to establish and carry out research in Austria. However, the aforementioned ministries not only engage in updating existing programmes to current needs but also create new funding opportunities for businesses, such as a digitalisation and growth fund (“Digitalisierungs- und Wachstumsfonds”) to scale-up business.","Universities, universities of applied sciences and non-university research organisations generate a broad spectrum of knowledge from very different fields of research on a daily basis. They are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining competitiveness and solving societal challenges in advanced economies where knowledge has become the most important factor of production. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to identify any valuable know how as quickly as possible in order to link researchers with potential co-operators and to foster knowledge transfer through networks, project partnerships, and exploitation of IP, licenses, patents and the founding of new enterprises. An important instrument for strengthening knowledge and technology transfer are the performance agreements. Therefore, universities and research organizations have established and institutionalized strategic knowledge and technology transfer by implementing their intellectual property rights and exploitation strategies. 

Austria has a long and internationally recognized tradition of “organised interfaces” between basic science and other actors and promotes knowledge transfer between universities, other research organisations and the private sector through knowledge-transfer centres. Technology-transfer coordinators at the universities act as contact persons for universities, non-university research institutes and companies. They provide an overview of all current research projects and appraise their commercial potential. All the public universities are participating.

A national contact point has been designated at the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research to address the European Commission’s IP Recommendation. One of its tasks is to co-ordinate measures to foster knowledge transfer between public research organisations and the private sector. This includes tackling transnational issues, in liaison with similar contact points in other Member States.

In cooperation with AWS (Austria Wirtschaftsservice), a working group organised by Austrian universities has drawn up an Intellectual Property Agreement Guide containing modular units on agreements covering co-operative ventures between universities and businesses. The Guide considers novel aspects of the law on service inventions, cartel law, the block-exemption regulation for technology transfer, and EU regulations for government funding of RTI (http://www.ipag.at/).

Academic spin-offs are another essential element in the effective transfer of academic knowledge. By founding spin-offs from universities and public-sector research institutions, young innovative entrepreneurs help ensure that the global market is kept supplied with fresh ideas and better solutions. Therefore, the “Spin-off Fellowships Programme” of the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research aims to step in at a very early stage: It enables researchers to concentrate exclusively on the further development of their research results and to exploit them in the form of a business start-up. They are supported for up to 18 months and receive a maximum subsidy of € 500.000. Since the beginning of the programme 24 projects have already started. The Fellowships Programme is endowed with € 15M and is coordinated and handled by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). (https://www.ffg.at/en/node/52752).

To develop a new RTI strategy until 2030, five thematic working groups have been established; one of them is dealing with the topic ""applied research and impact on economy and society"", which indicates that knowledge transfer will be an important part of the new RTI strategy. Furthermore, ""open innovation"" is a cross-sectional topic in the new RTI strategy, and the ""Open Innovation Strategy for Austria"", established in 2016, gives a clear vision regarding opening up the innovation system also between science and industry/business. When it comes to cooperation between science and industry, the OECD review of innovation reports Austria to be the leading country (2012-14). Numerous funding programmes (e.g. COMET) and associations (e.g. Christian Doppler Research Association) incentivize businesses to collaborate on innovation with higher education or research institutions. COMET centres and Christian Doppler labs account for the largest share of public investments in collaborative science-industry structures. As suggested in the OECD review of Austria's innovation policy, new ways of developing the COMET model further will be explored.","To develop a new RTI strategy until 2030, five thematic working groups have been established; one of them is explicitly dealing with the topic ""human resources"" (HR). Therefore, HR will be a pivotal part of the new RTI strategy. Further developing the human resource base is key to the overall success of the innovation system in the future. Despite rising employment levels in industry, the supply of graduates (particularly S&T) does not keep pace everywhere. Even more pressing is the situation with female graduates whose share in the S&T workforce in the private sector continues to stagnate at a rather low level, notwithstanding increases in absolute terms. An impact goal including budget and clear targets focuses on this issue.","To master the challenges laid out by the SDGs, STI policies will have to make a significant contribution to comprehensive ecological, economic and societal changes.

Five intra-ministerial thematic working groups have been established in line with the development of new RTI strategy 2030 with the aim of specifically addressing current issues (SDGs among them). In the current RTI strategy (2020), there was a working group implemented on “climate change and scarce resources”, with particular emphasis on global future energy supply.

Moreover, to tackle these global challenges international cooperation and capacity building in most vulnerable and affected regions is vital. To strengthen those aspects a new cooperation programme for development research has recently been launched.",
Belgium (Brussels authority),"A new government was formed in July 2019, which means budgetary, as well as strategic negotiations, are still ongoing at the time of preparing this text (November 2019). The outline below is therefore subject to change.

A main governance priority for 2020 is the drafting of a new Regional Innovation Plan. This plan will build on the region’s current strategy that was set for 2016 until 2020, and which defines a series of strategic axes. Innoviris (the Brussels regional institute for research and innovation) will conduct a consultation of the regional R&D ecosystem in order to update the current thematic priorities and the concomitant regional smart specialisation strategy. The operational plan for the new ERDF programming will also be drawn up in parallel, aiming to develop a coherent and structurally embedded innovation strategy. For both plans a monitoring and evaluation framework will be drawn up. 

Moreover, to ensure a comprehensive action perimeter, the legal framework has been updated very recently. Indeed, since spring 2019, two new implementing decrees entered into force. This includes, for instance, the recently created industrial spin-out programme and a programme that allows for the secondment of researchers/experts to small enterprises.
The new secretary of state competent for research and innovation is currently translating the coalition agreement into a more specific policy note focused on RDI. Different transition paths towards a low carbon, circular and inclusive economy will be, inter alia, the subject of a substantive reflection. This also includes, for instance, a reflection on the creation of social entrepreneurship support schemes. This ambitious strategy is also complemented by the preparation of a regional artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, which will be designed in a way to develop an ecosystem in AI that is compatible with the resolution of environmental and social challenges.","An important debate is developing around the importance of a balanced policy mix. Research, development and innovation (RDI) policy increasingly focuses on the development of challenge-oriented and top-down policy instruments. Safeguarding intellectual and creative independence is a challenge, both for programmes with academic and non-academic actors. The academic sector in particular calls for trust in knowledge institutions and the importance of sufficient resources for fundamental and free intellectual research.

Such a debate goes beyond the competences of the Brussels-Capital Region (BCR) and calls for a coordinated policy between the different political levels and areas of competence. The BCR’s particular focus is on creating bridges between research and development (i.e. knowledge transfer), between knowledge and innovation, within a number of strategic innovation areas and local strongholds, which are of paramount importance for the creation of sustainable socio-economic development of the Region. The Regional government does not solely impose research topics on research actors, but challenges research institutions and other research entities to come up with their own suggestions for thematic programmes, which are in line with the strengthening of the local socioeconomic fabric. 

Current policy support stresses new research configurations and methods, such as cooperative and co-creative research (living labs, experimental platforms, etc.) that bring together different research actors including academia, businesses, public bodies, and citizens. Technology/knowledge transfer between academia and society/industry and support of early-phase start-ups will be a key goal as well, all with the objective of accelerating the processes along the innovation chain and shortening the time-to-market or time-to-society. Therefore, the Region will continue its structural support to technology transfer offices, to encourage valorisation from academic research results. This support is regularly monitored to improve the efficiency of the Region’s technology transfer system. Besides, it is expected that academic research in the future will contribute even more to the production of knowledge that is specific to the Brussels context, allowing social and environmental challenges to be tackled.","Three broad topics seem to dominate ongoing policy debates regarding government support to business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship. 

Firstly, the last couple of years have been characterized by an important focus on the (business) innovation cycle. How can we make sure public support for RDI covers each step in the cycle? How to guarantee that business R&D actually results in new or improved products that are put to use in the market or in society at large? The Regional Innovation Plan (PRI, 2016-2020) of the Brussels Capital Region reflects this important debate. Indeed, the PRI has set in motion an entire range of actions that facilitate the innovation cycle (c.f. axis 1 of the PRI: ""Améliorer la chaîne de l'innovation""). In the meantime, the vast majority of these actions have become operational while some other actions are fully prepared but still need to launched. Some examples of actions are: proof of concept, proof of business, pre-seed funding, corporate spin-out, and secondment of researchers in SMEs. The first policy note of the Secretary of research and innovation of the new Brussels government (2019-2024) reaffirms the importance of the actions mentioned above. The note confirms that not only collaborative projects and technology transfer should be strengthened (e.g. via the programmes Joint R&D Project Call, Experimental Platforms, Corporate Spin-Out) but also innovative start-ups (e.g. Proof of Business, Bruseed).

Secondly, a debate has been ongoing on the importance of supporting not only traditional R&D actors, but also non-traditional RDI actors such as social entrepreneurs and non-profit organisations. This fits in with the idea that if a heterogeneous group of actors come together, it will be easier to arrive at (social) innovations that tackle a large variety of pressing societal challenges. As explained below, it is precisely such societal challenges (climate change, pollution, mobility, social welfare, etc.) that have moved to the forefront of the policy debate in Brussels. 

Thirdly, and very much related to the previous point, the general declaration of the new government of the Brussels Region (legislature 2019-2024) states that by 2030 all public support for businesses should be directed towards socially and ecologically responsible activities. For policy evaluators this means that they will have to turn to policy evaluation methods that are capable of measuring the societal and ecological impacts of business RDI projects.","The Regional Innovation Plan of the Brussels Region (PRI, 2016-2020) has put an important emphasis on various actions that stimulate the transfer of technology and knowledge from academia to industry (or the business sector at large). The plan has stimulated the strengthening of knowledge transfer offices in Brussels higher education institutes, including in university colleges. The plan further includes, for instance, actions related to the secondment of researchers in SMEs (ready to be launched) and the reform of the applied PHD program (operational). This latter programme incorporates an important knowledge transfer dimension by funding doctoral projects that are partly carried out in a company (or in a public administration). 

As clearly shown in the general policy declaration of the new Brussels government (2019-2024), cooperation between academic researchers, businesses, and the non-profit sector remains an important priority for the region. After all, cooperation spurs knowledge transfer and valorisation of research results. It is to be expected that funding programmes that stress collaborations and the transfer of knowledge – such as Innoviris’ Joint R&D project call, Co-Creation, or Experimental Platforms – will be continued and, most likely, become ever more important in the future. The above-mentioned general policy declaration also suggests a number of new initiatives that would promote knowledge sharing in specific sectors, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) or health. With regard to the former, the declaration launches the idea to create, in collaboration with digital industry and academia, an integrated research centre focused on AI. Regarding the latter, the declaration mentions the creation of an internationally renowned cancer research hub at the Erasmus campus in Brussels where researchers, hospitals, and start-ups interact, flourish, and take important steps forward in the fight against cancer.","Support for human resources in research and innovation in the Brussels Capital Region (BCR) depends on multiple areas of competence, some (e.g. employment, research and innovation) attributable to the BCR, others to the two regional language communities (e.g. education) – the Brussels-Wallonia Federation as well as the Flemish Community. Some of the debates therefore go beyond regional competences, and will therefore not be discussed further here.
The BCR has a great strategic advantage. With 86 000 students in higher education (2016), Brussels is the most important university city in Belgium. It has a great concentration of highly qualified human capital, which also positions Brussels at the top in comparison with other economically advanced regions in Europe. Moreover, the BCR has the highest proportion of the workforce active in R&D in Belgium. A major point of debate is the general shortage in STEM talents, and a large under-representation of women in STEM disciplines. Particularly the lack of a labour force skilled in computer sciences, programming and other advanced ICT is acute, bearing in mind the fact that the BCR is an IT hub, with a vibrant RDI ecosystem in this domain. 
A particularly regional challenge subject to debate concerns the substantial presence of weaker socioeconomic groups. The Brussels Region therefore provides funding to sensitising projects on science, targeting specific target groups such as young students, women, weaker and under-represented socioeconomic groups. The goal in the long run is to encourage more people to pursue a scientific career or be active in RDI. A strong focus is on the development of digital skills. At the moment, the Brussels Region intends to establish a “science do and experience center” that would reinforce the sensitising policy, with a physical location entirely dedicated to science awareness and skills development. This ambitious project is embedded in an inclusive approach to sensitise a large public to science.
Possessing of a sufficiently large knowledge base in universities and university colleges, and numerous non-profit organisations and NGO’s with social sciences and humanities (SSH) expertise, the BCR intends to increasingly incorporate SSH in its innovation support programmes, and believes SSH to be an integral part of research and innovation activities. Another debate focuses on the role of the traditional technology transfer offices (TTOs). Brussels universities’ TTOs are increasingly stimulated to go beyond their traditional role and competences of “the science-economy-society” link and to fulfill a role as facilitator for SSH collaborations with “hard” scientific projects and to stimulate valorization of SSH research results that lead to societal (beyond the mere technological) change. The role of schools of arts is subject to debate as well; more particularly, their role in the creative process of multilateral research projects.","The leading principle of the Brussels Capital Region's innovation policy is to ensure that emerging technologies and innovations do not incur detrimental impacts on its citizens and society. Innoviris, the regional Research Development and Innovation (RDI) funding agency, takes on the role of both innovation enabler and sustainer, developing a Responsible Research and Innovation policy. 

Innoviris financially supports (but not exclusively) key emerging technology domains (for which a vibrant local ecosystem is present). For instance, the region is a pioneer when it comes to actively supporting the AI domain – already doing so since 2016 with a dedicated call, ""team-up - AI"". Another promising area with a strong regional anchoring is, for example, biotechnology, supported by a call on predictive medicine. To encourage social, sustainable and inclusive valorisation, and thus more ethically responsible RDI, Innoviris seeks to encourage the creation of interdisciplinary project consortia and cooperation between the academic and non-academic, and profit and non-profit spheres. The collaboration between Social and Human Sciences (SHS) and non-SHS research domains still remains challenging but promising. Parallel programmes deal directly with tackling challenges following a large-scale proliferation of new technological solutions in daily lives. Themes such as the digital divide, pollution, mental health and precarity issues, and challenges related to the disintermediation of the economy have been covered. Often co-creative and live lab-inspired project designs are established, that are very much practice-oriented. The identification of societal challenges for thematic calls is based on a participatory process of ""entrepreneurial discovery"", in which all regional stakeholders are given the opportunity to put forward their input. In this way, using public funds, Innoviris tries to carry out its responsibility to society.

A definitive guarantee of a responsible RDI support policy requires the application of an ethical framework. Such a framework is still being drawn up. It intends to induce beneficiaries to undertake RDI projects ""ethical by design"". Practically this concerns compliance with the codes of ethics in research and development and with the prevailing (legally binding) ethical frameworks. Today, generally, a considerable number of existing research protocols and legal frameworks are either not, only partially, or incorrectly applied by researchers. Besides the importance of respecting more familiar frameworks such as GDPR in research in the field of AI and data, the emphasis will be broader. Rather than penalising, the framework will focus primarily on empowering researchers.",
Belgium (Federal Government authority),"National STI policy aims to take into account new challenges like AI, demographic changes, globalisation, digitalisation, the energy transition, climate change, and sustainable development. To face those important challenges, various initiatives have been decided and will be implemented in the near future, including: 
-	developing expertise inside the Federal science policy office (Belspo),
-	launching programmes on emerging topics,
-	creating a climate platform,
-	creating a consultative body concerning R&I in the digital world,
-	developing a federal ScienceCloud, and
-	creating an autonomous space agency.

The previous government planned to reform the federal administration in charge of science policies (Belspo). The objectives were to: 
-	increase the autonomy of the federal scientific research institutes; 
-	create an autonomous space agency; and
-	integrate the Federal science policy office into another federal administratio

These reforms are still pending. The new government has to decide whether they want to execute them or decide upon other reforms (or none at all).","The debate concerning the federal public research system mainly focuses on increasing the autonomy of the research institutes and the best way this could be achieved. This debate also concerns the division of labour between the central administration on the one hand and the institutes on the other hand. For example, will there be performance agreements, and if so, what will they stipulate?

All federal research institutes under Belspo have been peer reviewed. Recommendations were issued on the scientific performance as well as on the organisational structure. Some general conclusions are in the process of being elaborated that will to look at some elements common to all of the institutes. 

Other federal research institutes (not under Belspo) working in public health have been merged to create bigger organisations, with more resources (human and money wise) and avoiding duplication of research, which has mutually enriched the different research departments.","For space matters, the ongoing policy debates relate to the agenda of the ESA Council at Ministerial Level in late 2019: to what programmes will Belgium subscribe? What is the motivation for such subscription? What is the relation between the EC space initiatives and the ESA space programmes? How can we increase the participation of Belgian space stakeholders to EC space programmes, by supporting them via ESA programmes? 

The Belgian space strategy has several aims, including to:
-	support scientific actors and to promote them as Prime Investigators for scientific missions in Europe and worldwide, 
-	support industry and help them being competitive in Europe and worldwide, and
-	support space programs that promote international collaboration in space.

Tax incentives have been in place for a while. As part of their regular updated evaluation reports, the planning bureau (bureau du plan) started a discussion regarding the efficiency of each of these measures, revealing that some of them show no input additionality regarding research.","Science policy in Belgium is a mixed competence between the federal and the regional levels. This poses particular challenges and requires good coordination between the different levels. For space matters, the competence is almost entirely in the hands of the federal authority. Belgium is an ESA member. Thanks to this membership, many Belgian enterprises/research groups take part in ESA programmes. For knowledge transfer and sharing, the ESA rules are followed. These provide a good balance between industrial property rights and the effective use and spread of the high technology that has been developed through ESA programmes.","As the responsibilities for research and innovation have been transferred to the regions and communities during the 1990s, the competences left at the federal level regarding human resources management (in the field of STI) are limited. The remaining fields are the following: 
-	Management of the researchers in the 17 federal research institutes. The researchers have more or less the same legal status (which was reproduced from the university system in the past). As part of a debate to grant the research institutes greater autonomy, there could be consequences for the legal status of their researchers, though this remains unclear. 
-	The main tax incentive for research is based on lowering the cost of researchers. The system is not new and no major changes have taken place. There is, however, a recent debate on access to the system. Some demand making it more generous (and consequently more costly), while others would prefer it to become less generous (and less costly). This is something for the new government to decide upon.","At the federal level, sustainable development policy is managed by the Federal Institute for Sustainable Development (IFDD) and coordinated by the Interdepartmental Commission (CIDD). The members of this Commission are delegates from the federal and regional public administration. Societal challenges are mainly addressed through the following three projects:
1.	The Belgian pathways to sustainable development report (2016-2030).
2.	The ""plan fédéral de lutte contre la pauvreté (2016-2019)(SPP Intégration sociale)"".
3.	The Belgian Research Action through Interdisciplinary Networks (BRAIN-be) (2012-2020).",
Belgium (Flanders authority),"In its policy memorandum 2019-2024, the VARIO (Flemish Advisory Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship) calls for the development of an efficient and targeted governance framework, amongst others to:
-	Speed up the development of a long term vision on innovation and translate this into a strategy with specific objectives.
-	Strengthen systems thinking, transversality, coordination and structural cooperation within the Flemish government to embed innovation in its DNA. Put the intentions in Vision 2050 into practice.
-	Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the support instruments, individually and as part of a system. 
-	Make decision-making more evidence-based.

In response to the first two bullet points, the minister for Economy, Science and Innovation, in her policy note covering 2019-2024, has unveiled a mission-oriented policy around 6 transversal projects, all of which contain elements of STI policy.
1.	Under a thriving local entrepreneurship, initiatives such as Smart City Flanders can be found. Flanders has the ambition to become a frontrunner in this domain.
2.	An integrated industrial policy for the future will ensure the competitiveness and productivity of Flanders’ manufacturing industry. A more strategic approach to IPCEI’s will be developed. Flanders is participating in the European Commission’s Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) programme on Batteries and has a keen interest in the IPCEI on Hydrogen, in which it wants to become a world leader.
3.	(Sub-)regional smart specialisation needs to ensure that the innovation potential of all areas in Flanders is tapped into. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) will be instrumental in implementing this policy.
4.	An integrated agenda for digital entrepreneurship and innovation should allow Flanders’ top researchers and digital economy to take a leading position internationally. Attention is given to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity (research, deployment and supporting measures), industry 4.0, and the support to digitisation in other policy domains (transport, education, etc.). An area covering 5G-networks should create an enabling environment for innovations.
5.	An ambitious plan for climate innovation should lead to solutions for a low-carbon industry and society. 
6.	A maximal circular economy should cut back waste and safeguard resources for the future. Research and innovative business models are central to this project. 

The policy will be governed by three central principles:
-	Ambition: for example, Flanders wants to become one of the top five innovation regions in Europe. Excellence is the basis of regional science policy. Scale-ups are encouraged to conquer the world.
-	Impact: instruments and policies will be evaluated on the impact they generate, both economically and societally (thus responding to the last two bullets above).
-	Cooperation: the minister will seek to develop the quadruple helix model in which knowledge institutions, enterprises, governments and citizens work closely together. More cooperation between disciplines and sectors will also be stimulated.","In its policy memorandum 2019-2024, the VARIO (Flemish Advisory Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship) calls to continue to focus on research and innovation as a priority. The goal must be to achieve the 1% objective for publicly funded R&D intensity by the end of the next government period.

As regards R&D expenditures, Flanders has been catching up strongly in the past few years. In 2017, Flanders invested 7,499 billion EUR or 2,89% of GDP in R&D (GERD/GDP). Flanders scores remarkably better than the EU average, and it is year after year improving its position compared to the EU average. At this moment, Flanders just falls short of belonging to the absolute European top.

In 2019, the government further increased expenditure for science and innovation (+15%) and R&D-expenditure increased by 19% compared to 2018. This is the result of an increase in the annual budget for R&D and economy of 280 million EUR and of a one-off investment of 120 million EUR. In total, 2.9 billion EUR was foreseen for science and innovation of which 1.9 billion EUR was specifically assigned to R&D.

The aim of the government is to reach the 3% target for R&D-expenditure by 2024. This means that by 2024, there will be a 250 million EUR increase in the annual budget for R&D. During the period 2019-2024, 195 million EUR of one-off investments will be made in R&D-infrastructure.","In its policy memorandum 2019-2024, the VARIO (Flemish Advisory Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship) calls for particular attention to innovative high-growth companies, young companies, but also more mature companies in a new growth phase, given their role in job creation, and for a vibrant and dynamic economy. 

Flanders will stimulate entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial culture and the growth of its SMEs. Efforts will be made to remove the barriers that SMEs are facing when innovating and doing business. Particular attention will be given to broadening the innovation base to small businesses (customized procedures, better connection with clusters) and restoring the productivity growth.

One of the transversal projects of the minister is developing an integrated agenda for digital entrepreneurship and innovation.","In its policy memorandum 2019-2024, the VARIO (Flemish Advisory Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship) underlines the importance of cooperation between the Flemish R&D&I-actors in achieving value creation, where it sees an important role for the Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship Agency (VLAIO) to attract new companies into the innovation pool.

In order to offer companies access to knowledge and to valorize innovation economically, Flanders continues to invest in the Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship Agency (VLAIO) set of instruments for co-operation and knowledge sharing between companies and knowledge institutions, and between companies themselves. The cluster policy (spearhead clusters: Catalisti, Flux 50, Strategic Materials Initiative, Flemish Innovation Platform Logistics, Flanders' Food and the Blue Cluster) will be continued. The feasibility of a spearhead cluster in the field of personalized medicine will be evaluated.

Flanders will strengthen the interaction between knowledge institutions and Flemish industry with regard to industrial research agendas, to eliminate the 'knowledge mismatch' between what Flemish universities produce and what Flemish industry demands. Flanders will investigate how it can strengthen the involvement of Flemish companies in strategic basic research, Technology Transfer Offices (TTO’s) and research infrastructure.

In the last few years, at the request of or in consultation with economic and social actors, important initiatives have been started as part of a more mission-oriented innovation policy. This includes the Moonshot (transition to a carbon-smart economy), the transition priorities, and the policy agendas for artificial intelligence and cyber security. Within regular innovation and cluster policy, resources are also needed for this type of research, linked to major societal challenges such as climate, digitisation, aging, etc.

Flanders also intends to support higher TRLs (Technology Readiness Levels) and develop a framework for supporting pilot and demonstration plants.","In its policy memorandum 2019-2024, the VARIO (Flemish Advisory Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship) pays attention to the development of talent as the region’s most important resource. The Council asks, amongst others, for: 
-	Increased efforts to address the shortage of STEM graduates and to inspire young people to consider STEM training and professions; 
-	Encouraging the implementation of innovative forms of education, including embracing the most recent digital techniques.
-	Encouraging intersectoral mobility between knowledge institutions, enterprises, the service sector, the non-profit sector and government. 
Science communication is a separate chapter in the policy note for 2019-2024. Science communication is not only seen as a way to foster trust in science and scientists, it is also instrumental in firing up the passion for science and innovation amongst citizens.
A new STEM action plan 2020-2030 has been announced, on which stakeholders will be consulted. It should be a broad action plan that also has sufficient attention for vocational professions and technical and special education. It will link STEM more explicitly to overcoming grand societal challenges. Furthermore, the government explicitly aims for a “STEM Academy” in every commune, through which youngsters aged 8 to 14 years can interact with STEM.
The active engagement of citizens in making science will be stimulated by (1) fostering contacts between scientists and citizens in all relevant fora (science festivals, science cafés, science days, etc.); (2) bringing more researchers and scientists into the media through science journalism; and (3) announcing regular calls for citizen science projects. 
The Flanders government also plans to develop the “School of the Future”, to create a hypermodern digital school with an innovative labour organization, where students are driven to attain digital and other future-oriented skills. A pilot project is due to start in 2020.
Apart from science communication, another important measure relating to human resources is to better prepare doctoral students for a career outside the academic world. Industrial traineeships and innovation “stages” for researchers are possible instruments. Mobility in general is a priority, not only between the academic and private sector, but also internationally and interdisciplinary. Universities will be encouraged to develop a structural policy on mobility and to increase mobility.","In the policy note for 2019-2024, the minister for Economy, Science and Innovation has unveiled a mission oriented policy around six transversal projects, amongst which is an ambitious plan for climate innovative solutions for a low-carbon industry and a maximal circular economy, with the aim to reduce waste and safeguard resources for the future. 

In the case of climate innovative solutions, a “moonshot”-programme was created to develop low-carbon technologies for Flanders’ industry. The programme foresees an annual investment of 20 million EUR for the next 20 years. One important focus of the programme is Carbon Capture Usage and Storage.

The circular economy mission is encompassing domains such as the bio-economy, food policy, energy and other primary resources. A specific mission or research policy agenda for the circular economy and the bio-economy have been proposed as an option.

The policy note for 2019-24 also highlights other societal challenges, such as ageing (Flanders Care), smart transport (Mobilidata), and water (VLIZ, De Blauwe Cluster). All of these initiatives are underpinned by the quadruple helix model in which knowledge institutions, enterprises, governments, and citizens work closely together. Also worth mentioning is that greater attention will be paid to the impact of institutions and policy instruments, including their contributions to solutions to societal challenges.

The explicit integration and follow-up of the SDG’s is done through the Vizier 2030 strategy of the Flemish Government.

Flanders continues its investments in a sustainable financing model for its four strategic research centers (IMEC, VIB, VITO, Flanders Make) to ensure their sustainable growth.",
Belgium (Wallonia authority),"One main debate concerns the complexity of the Walloon STI system. It appears that this system offers many tools that are managed by a variety of operators. This wide range of aid covers the entire technology readiness level (TRL) scale, and, if overlaps have been identified, these usually result from differences between the target groups and different objectives of the aid. However, for an outside observer, the Walloon system appears fragmented and its coherence is hardly perceptible. In addition, the missions of the operators are defined with insufficient precision, which adds complexity to the system.

It is necessary to highlight the relevant aids by objective pursued (industrial research, experimental development, research in partnership, prototyping, intellectual property, marketing, etc.). It is also important to highlight the links between the various aids to identify those that can be used successively during the life cycle of a project. Highlighting relays that could be implemented with economic policy instruments would also be useful for the TRL steps closest to commercialization.

For the Walloon Science Policy Council (“Pole Politique Scientifique” or PPS), the development by the public authorities of a strategic management of the research, development and innovation (RDI) system is an essential element. This would allow the Walloon government to pilot the system, to adapt it quickly to the needs of the various actors, and to measure the impacts of the instruments put in place on the quality of research and on the socio-economic development of Wallonia. Accordingly, the Walloon government intends to enhance good governance, by continuing the digitization and administrative simplification of RDI policy, and by carrying out systematic evaluation.","In 2019, the PPS (Walloon Science Policy Council) identified five main issues relevant for research policy in Wallonia in which the government must act:
-	Continue and expand recent efforts to raise public R&D spending to 1% of GDP to reach the 3% target by 2020, with special attention to the financing of universities and fundamental research;
-	Develop the strategic management of the regional RDI system;
-	Facilitate the valorisation of research results, for example, by taking into account the valorisation dimension throughout the research project’s development and by facilitating the access of firms to the skills necessary to put a new product on the market (financing, marketing, etc.);
-	Implement an integrated STEM strategy; and
-	Encourage Walloon research teams to participate in European research programmes by developing a strong policy to increase the number of applicants and improve their success rate.","A recurring debate in Wallonia concerns innovation in SMEs. Indeed, the Walloon industrial environment is made up of a majority of small businesses, many of which do not engage in innovation. In the current economic context, a more innovative approach could allow these companies to strengthen their activities, particularly via new markets. The question of their access to the government’s innovation support system is therefore central.

The PPS (Walloon Science Policy Council) believes that setting up a personalised support for companies, particularly SMEs, would make it easier for them to identify the most appropriate aid to further develop a project. This support seems particularly relevant at the time of the first contact of an SME with the regional RDI system and should facilitate the pursuit of innovation activities.","The Walloon regional government has undertaken efforts in recent years to promote more collaboratios between the research and innovation actors in Wallonia:
-	Supporting partnerships between the scientific community and firms: through measures such as the Competitive Poles, or research programmes such as CWALity, Win2Wal, FIRST, etc.
-	Strengthening technology transfers: financing academic Knowledge Transfer Offices (KTOs) and the LIEU network (“Liaison Entreprises-Universités”, i.e. “link firms-universities”);
-	Networking the operators of scientific and technologic intermediation; and
-	Better protection of IP in R&D projects based on partnerships.","The PPS (Walloon Science Policy Council) highly recommends the implementation of an integrated STEM strategy to fight against the decline of S&T graduates. Four orientations are proposed:
-	Provide better information on scientific and technical professions: implement specific actions for the age group 16-18, better coordinate and programme actions, articulate initiatives with educational programmes, and develop actions based on a practical approach (object design, internships in companies, etc.);
-	Rethink science education: further integrate technology into science courses, reduce constraints on infrastructure and hardware, strengthen teachers’ expertise, and raise awareness about the specificities of science education. Partnerships should be developed with universities, ‘Hautes Ecoles’, businesses and research centers to support schools and teachers;
-	Develop actions aimed specifically at girls: strengthen the role of women scientists as an example, encourage more girls to enter these careers (role of teachers and parents), provide better information on the diversity of careers offered to STEM graduates; and
-	Restore formal contacts between secondary and higher education.","The 2019-2024 regional program puts an emphasis on sustainable development, especially by developing the circular economy and the silver economy, and by addressing climate change. The Government has started a process to renew the regional Smart Specialisation Strategy (S3) for the 2021-2027 programming period. This will be performed on the basis of a co-creation process (EDP) mobilizing the “quadruple helix”. The answer to societal challenges will be a guiding principle of the process, with the aim to define new Priority Innovation Domains which are relevant both from an economic and innovation point of view and a societal perspective. The S3 will be an overarching strategy for regional innovation and innovation policies, and will steer improvements in the policy mix.

The economic instruments will also further include societal aspects such as circular economy, wellbeing, ageing, climate change.

The Walloon government also intends to support democratic innovation to include citizens in decision making:
-	Set up mixed parliamentary committees made up of elected officials and citizens, drawn on the basis of a university methodology guaranteeing the representativeness of the panel. One of these committees would be dedicated to climate change;
-	Study the creation of a citizen assembly of the future, composed of elected officials and citizens, whose role would be to consider long-term challenges.",
Brazil,"Public debates around national Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policies have been influenced by larger political issues deriving from the 2019 presidential elections. The new administration came into office in 2019 with new visions on the role of government in a broad array of activities. Although the main pillars of the national STI policies have not been substantially changed, a completely new set of questions has arisen on policy management and implementation.

The National STI Strategy continues to set out the main policy ambitions and still provides the main guidelines for the design of STI initiatives. The strategy is based on a fundamental axis: the expansion, consolidation and integration of the National STI System. Expansion implies increasing research institutions, human resources dedicated to R&D and available research infrastructure. Consolidation involves preserving and improving past accomplishments, whereas integration makes reference to a new and improved institutional framework that facilitates and streamlines the coordination and cooperation among different agents of the STI system.

This main axis is supported by five pillars: (i) fostering basic and technological research; (ii) improving research infrastructures; (iii) increasing research and innovation funding; (iv) developing human resources; and, (iv) creating incentives for innovation in private firms.

The new administration taking office in 2019, however, has brought a new vision on the role of government, particularly regarding how government policies and activities should be managed. Although many of the proposed reforms have yet to be implemented (some of them are still being designed) there is a strong debate focused on a more efficient and streamlined public administration. This has been partly motivated by persistent fiscal restrictions.

While budget constraints keep limiting the amount of public support for R&D, the search for new sources of funding has gained importance. On the one hand, there is strong debate on how to secure government funding for public research, human capital building and for other research activities that are not attractive to private investors. On the other hand, discussions have emerged on how to attract private funding for R&D activities. New proposals range from the implementation of endowment funds (now regulated by Law no. 13 800, 04/JAN/2019) to joint research projects with the private sector. In this context, debates have also focused on the need to pursue new mission-oriented initiatives involving private companies and public research institutions. 

On the policy management front, the new government has proposed broad horizontal changes in public administration, known as the “administrative reform”. Most of these reforms have to be discussed and approved in Congress. The new proposals seek to decentralize many policy decisions and management, and look for a more efficient and streamlined public sector.

Some of these trends have already impacted the federal management of national STI policies. For example, the merger of the Ministries of Communications and of Science, Technology and Innovation has been maintained. Further integration of the former two ministries is now being pursued through a new organisational structure that reflects different areas of STI policy . In particular, administrative units were designed to focus on: (i) basic research; (ii) applied research; and, (iii) technology development and application. These are supervised by a planning and project-coordinating unit. This new organisational structure aims to improve the translation of scientific knowledge into objective results in bringing solutions to enduring societal challenges.","The main ongoing policy debates around Brazil’s government support for the public research system are: (i) private sector links; (ii) priority setting; and (iii) undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate evaluation incentives.

Private sector links
Brazil’s public research system needs to be further linked with the private sector, particularly by better addressing its needs and opportunities. There should be an increase in the number of public research system-private sector interactions, collaborations and partnerships. This could be fostered throughout the public research system’s governance and operations. 

Priority setting
This debate focuses on how the public budget for research should be distributed amongst the scientific areas and industries so that Brazil maximizes the economic and social returns of STI investments. The adoption of mission-oriented innovation policy principles is being explored as a possible approach.

Undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate evaluation incentives
This debate concerns evaluation incentives in higher education currently present in Brazil’s public research system, i.e. evaluation criteria for undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate education and research production. In particular, whether these stimulate the Brazilian education and research community the right behaviors and decisions which may enhance their contributions to Brazil’s economic and social development. Appropriate criteria should drive teachers, students and researchers to: (i) focus on areas and subjects more related to the main national challenges; (ii) increase their involvement with private sector R&D; and, (iii) stimulate their entrepreneurship ambitions.

Aiming at increasing value-added content of key production chains, the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTI) is launching a series of Applied Technology Centers (ATCs). These are meant to act as hubs for national laboratories and research institutions. The first ATCs focus on artificial intelligence and advanced materials (niobium, rare earths, graphene and other carbon-based nano-materials). ATC labs complement the existing lab network and integrate public research institutions and companies in both setting R&D targets and sharing costs. There are plans for other ATCs, the next focusing on assistive technologies for handicapped individuals and on water (covering scientific, economic and social dimensions).","The main ongoing policy debates around Brazil’s government support to business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship focus on: (i) regulation; (ii) venture capital availability; and, (iii) talent availability.

Regulation
This debate centres on how flexible and appropriate regulation in Brazil is to absorb, support and accelerate business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship. This, taking into account multiple dimensions such as disruptive business models and technologies, ease of doing business, science-industry cooperation and openness to foreign innovative products, processes and services. 

Venture capital availability
This debate deals with venture capital availability in Brazil, necessary for financing its expected volume of business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship initiatives. In particular, a key discussion concerns whether the government can better contribute to the growth of a robust venture capital market. 

Talent availability
This debate explores whether the talent needed to achieve the potential for business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship initiatives is available in Brazil. Particular emphasis is given to how public sector education and the research system can better prepare and develop these talents. This includes embedding the necessary innovation and entrepreneurship skills and the specialization in prioritized scientific areas.","The main ongoing policy debates around Brazil’s national policy for science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing are: (i) upgrading the intellectual property framework; (ii) science-industry links; and, (iii) talent availability.

Upgrading the intellectual property framework 
This debate regards how up to date is the Brazilian intellectual property framework so that it is able to stimulate, support and accelerate the creation of knowledge, and its codification as intellectual property assets, throughout the public research system; and the transference and sharing of knowledge to the industry through intellectual property assets.

Science-industry links
Brazil’s public research system needs to be further linked with the private sector, particularly by better addressing its needs and opportunities. There should be an increase in the number of public research system-private sector interactions, collaborations and partnerships. This could be fostered throughout the public research system’s governance and operations. 

Talent availability
This debate explores whether the talent needed to achieve the potential for business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship initiatives is available in Brazil. Particular emphasis is given to how public sector education and the research system can better prepare and develop these talents. This includes embedding the necessary innovation and entrepreneurship skills and the specialization in prioritized scientific areas.","The main ongoing policy debates around Brazil’s government support for human resources for research and innovation are: (i) STEM focus; (ii) national vocations and opportunities; and, (iii) undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate evaluation incentives.
STEM focus
This debate focuses on the need to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduates in Brazil, as the corresponding disciplines are at the core of the main research and innovation opportunities.
National vocations and opportunities
This debate centres on how Brazil’s main research and innovation vocations and opportunities should drive: (i) the allocation of public resources; and, (ii) the creation of evaluation incentives aimed at developing human resources for research and innovation. Embedding mission-oriented innovation policy principles into the Brazilian STI policy framework is currently being explored.
Undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate evaluation incentives
This debate concerns evaluation incentives in higher education currently present in Brazil’s public research system, i.e. evaluation criteria for undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate education and research production. In particular, whether these stimulate the Brazilian education and research community the right behaviours and decisions which may enhance their contributions to Brazil’s economic and social development. Appropriate criteria should drive teachers, students and researchers to: (i) focus on areas and subjects more related to the main national challenges; (ii) increase their involvement with private sector R&D; and, (iii) stimulate their entrepreneurship ambitions.","The current main policy debates on how national policy for research and innovation can help address societal challenges are: (i) setting mission-oriented policy; and, (ii) national innovation system governance.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are being incorporated into STI policy design and implementation through the gradual alignment of STI policies, strategies and plans. In particular, the National Economic and Social Development Strategy has been designed to address SDGs.

The Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications (MCTIC) is responsible for innovation policies that increase sustainability. These policies focus on the following areas: (i) low carbon emissions technologies; (ii) energy efficiency; (iii) urban efficiency; (iv) cleaner production; (v) reduction of waste generation; and, (vi) the circular economy. It is important that economic development initiatives lead to investments in environmental technologies, aiming at separating economic growth from environmental degradation, resource depletion and diminishing health and sanitation conditions.

Transitioning from fossil fuel-based energy systems to low-carbon, renewable energy systems requires renewed effort towards the adoption of sustainable solutions. Although there are already relevant technological solutions for sustainability, several factors prevent their implementation: institutional rules, political choices and socio-cultural attitudes. In order to break through these barriers, co-financing agreements and approaches that bring together broad stakeholder involvement (municipalities, businesses, academia and civil society) are necessary.",
Bulgaria,"The National Development Programme BULGARIA 2030 is the main strategic document in the hierarchy of the national programming documents, which determines the vision and overall goals of development policies in all sectors of government, including their territorial dimensions. The document sets out three strategic goals, five development areas (axes) and 13 national priorities. BULGARIA 2030 embarks on a deliberate analysis of the socio-economic development of the country after its accession to the European Union, aiming to identify key areas of concern and gaps in the country's development policies. The document is discussed and agreed with the socio-economic partners within the Economic and Social Council and the National Tripartite Cooperation Council.

Following the approval by the Council of Ministers of the vision, goals and priorities of BULGARIA 2030, the government intends to detail the policy areas and prepare an indicative financial framework, ex ante impact assessment and a mechanism to monitor and control the implementation of the Strategy.","The Ministry of Education and Science (MES) is now at the final stage of an agreement with the World Bank to review public expenditures on R&D, which will cover analysis of the quality and coherence of the policy mix. The World Bank will assist MES in performing an in-depth analysis of the design, implementation and governance of specific STI support instruments, by institution and by their position within the policy mix. The analysis will consist of collecting information on a sample of STI programmes. The World Bank will support MES in evaluating the efficiency of a sample of existing STI instruments to measure their ability to produce expected outputs given the inputs and resources used. The analysis consists of collecting information for a sample of STI programmes on administrative costs, and a survey model of beneficiaries to collect information on outputs and the quality of services provided. This will support designing of the next programming period 2021-2027 for research and innovation instruments.

In 2018, as a result of the European Commission’s support through its Policy Support Facility (PSF), Bulgaria introduced an update of its Research Performance Assessment procedures, using bibliometric counts of publications, weighted on the basis of the quality of journals, in combination with Category normalized citation based impact metrics to take into account both the volume as well as the actual impact of the research output. Other factors that are taken into consideration include the integration of research teams in national and international networks, and PhD graduates. The system considers the ability of the evaluated organisations to attract funding, patents registered and share of open science publications. The Assessment Committee is to report the annual evaluation analyses of the ROs and HEIs performance, presented by research areas. 

One of the mechanisms through which the performance based system in Bulgaria aims to improve the efficiency of the research system is through the concentration of resources. This has been introduced in 2018 in the design of the National Science Programmes pilot. Areas of impact have been identified as a result of prior consultations with the Ministries and Regional Administrations in order to achieve synergy between sectoral policies and programmes. The selection of beneficiaries for the implementation of the activities under the National Science Programmes and the distribution of the funding is based on an analysis of the results of the scientific activities of the ROs and HEIs in the respective scientific field. In this way, a funding mechanism based on the results is put in place.

The differentiation between research-oriented HEIs and HEIs focused on tuition is fundamental for the quality improvement. The Ordinance regulating the state subsidies for HEIs’ specific research activities, (Ordinance, under the art. 91 of the Higher Education Law, on the conditions and procedure for the planning, distribution and spending of the subsidies from the state budget allocated for the specific scientific research or artistic activities of the state higher education institutions) has been applied since 2014 and the share of funding depends on the results from the application of scientific performance indicators (e.g. publications, citation impact, PhD graduates, patents) of the State HEIs.","Under the OP “Innovation and competitiveness” 2014-2020, procedures for the “Creation and Development of Regional Innovation Centers” and “Development of Innovation Clusters” were announced.
-	Development of Innovation Clusters supports the promotion of cluster innovation by sharing facilities, sharing knowledge and experience, contributing effectively to knowledge transfer, building concrete networks of interdependent actors, often competing in the open market, disseminating information between enterprises and other organisations in the cluster.
-	Creation and Development of Regional Innovation Centers aims to build and develop a modern research and innovation infrastructure for conducting open-type applied research, contributing to the accelerated economic and social development of the Bulgarian regions. The focus of the procedure is on creating a working partnership between business and science for the benefit of the regional economy. Businesses have a leading role in creating the conditions for maximum use of the products of regional innovation centres, by introducing and commercialising the new technologies created in them. Another important aspect is the creation of an innovative and technological culture that underpins the success of this partnership.

Given the strategic importance of the topic, all EU Member States (incl. Bulgaria) signed the Declaration of Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Digital Day 2018. According to the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence “by mid-2019 all Member States are encouraged to put in place – and share with other Member States and the Commission - national AI strategies or programmes or add AI dimensions in other relevant strategies and programmes outlining investment levels and implementation measures.”

The Coordinated Plan is quite ambitious as it envisions many initiatives, funded by the EC, incl. through Horizon 2020. In the Bulgarian context, the relevant national institution is the Ministry of Economy (ME), which is also responsible for the Industry 4.0 Strategy. The ME intends to include an AI pillar in the Industry 4.0 Strategy, and afterwards it will develop a standalone AI Strategy.

The Ministry of Education and Science (MES) is also in the process of developing a document on AI in education and science. When the process is finalised, it can and should be used as input in the ME’s strategies. The timeline of this process however is unclear as the topic is quite complex and sensitive, especially when it comes to education. The MES stands ready to support the ME in this exercise of common interest. The draft Strategy for Bulgaria’s participation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) identifies the creation of conditions to deploy AI technologies in industry as one of the main priorities. Accompanying measures have been planned for this priority, and they will be included in the Action Plan for the Strategy.","The government has opened a national science portal, including information about its research programmes, research infrastructures, and researchers. Furthermore, in early 2019, the government has started to elaborate a National Open Science Portal and national repository. 

Key to promoting the commercialisation of research results and to fostering collaboration between academia and business are Competence Centers and Centers of Excellence, which are currently being developed and modernised with the support of the OP “Science and education for smart growth” 2014-2020. The centers will create the necessary conditions to attract highly qualified scientists to conduct research at the highest European level and will significantly improve the potential for applied research, experimental development and innovation in the regions, within the thematic areas of the Bulgarian Innovation strategy for Smart Specialization: Mechatronics and Clean Technologies, Informatics and ICT, Industry and healthcare and biotechnologies in the Creative and Recreative industries. All projects are prepared and implemented in partnership between different scientific organisations, incl. universities, academic institutes, structures of national institutions, etc.) and aim to improve the existing scientific infrastructure to facilitate the implementation of research and development, the transfer of knowledge and technology, the dissemination of research results, and the provision of research business services.

The Decree of the Council of Ministers on the establishment and functioning of a Mechanism for the awarding and implementation of scientific consultations by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences has been adopted. The main objective of the mechanism is to provide timely high quality and independent scientific expertise for the benefit of executive authorities of the Republic of Bulgaria on issues of strategic importance in formulating policies and instruments for the implementation of state policy, as well as in the transposition of European Union Directives in Bulgarian legislation. The mechanism aims to strengthen evidence-based policy-making in view of the new challenges connected with the increasing interdisciplinary nature of policies (such as in the spheres of climate, energy, transport, artificial intelligence, bioeconomy).

The Council of Ministers adopted a report submitted by the Vice-Prime minister on November 2019 for increasing the quality of the policies and the management of the research and innovation system. The report proposes the establishment of a State agency for research and innovation. An inter-institutional core team was established and held its first meeting in mid-December 2019. During 2020 the team will draft the preparation and realization of Agency which will incorporate an integrated approach of the policy process related to applied research and innovation development and will ensure the long-term planning and sustainability of financial resources for policymaking.","Efforts are being made in two directions:
-	Increase in PhD student grants;
-	Implementation of a national programme for young scientists and post-doctoral researchers.  

Additionally, a Decision of the Council of Ministers has seen the adoption of the following:
-	Peter Beron National Scientific Programme and Innovation With Europe (Peter Beron and IWE)
-	National Scientific Research and People for European Science Development (Vihren)
-	In 2019 two calls for proposals under the Peter Beron and VIHREN programmes were opened with the aim of attracting researchers from abroad, including from the research diaspora to work in Bulgarian universities and public research organisations. 

A proposal for a National Program for European Science Networks is currently under development, which provides funding for Bulgarian projects participating in the Twinning scheme, submitted and evaluated highly in Horizon 2020, with the principle of financing the most recent projects that have built successful partnerships and have agreements with European universities and scientific organizations.

The Bulgarian education system has been traditionally supportive of STEM, providing students with numerous opportunities to broaden their experience in the STEM fields outside the curriculum. Currently several non-government and academic organisations are responsible for the bulk of the STE(A)M initiatives in Bulgaria and most of them work closely with policymakers, trying to ensure the sustainability of their initiatives, some of which have been standing for decades and have turned into an institution of their own.

In addition to the amendments to the Law on Higher Education, which were approved by the Council of Ministers and tabled for discussion in the National Assembly, there are already concrete changes in the legal framework aimed at increasing the attractiveness of the professional fields cited. Specific examples in this regard are:
1.	Raising the standard of support for the training of students in the professional fields of sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics.
2.	Targeted scholarships provided for students in specialties in these professional fields.
3.	An increase in the number of state-subsidised places for training students in STEM areas.","The main goal of the Bulgarian Government is to swiftly modernise the R&I system so that public trust in science, economic growth and the quality of life are significantly increased.

Another objective is to improve the communication policies and practices of research organisations and the HEIs, as well as public institutions with regards to research activities and results, following the principles of transparency and openness. This shall affect the scientific culture of society, as well as help counter the spread of pseudoscience.

The National Research Programmes are focused toward solving current social issues, e.g. regarding the environment, health, culture, etc. The Ministry of Education and Science also supports the development of research infrastructures, which have a direct or indirect impact on society and on government policies. These infrastructures also participate in the ERICs or in consortiums that could be established as ERICs.",
Canada,"In 2016, the Government of Canada launched the Fundamental Science Review to help ensure that federal support for research is strategic and effective and that it delivers the greatest benefits possible to the research community and the Canadians whose lives are enriched by its discoveries. In response to this review, the Government of Canada has implemented a new suite of supports and governance mechanisms, such as: 
-	A Chief Science Advisor was appointed to ensure that government science is fully available to the public. This also involves ensuring that government scientists can speak freely about their work and that scientific analyses are considered when the government makes decisions. 
-	A new Canada Research Coordinating Committee was created to improve the coordination efforts of Canada's granting agencies and the Canada Foundation for Innovation, ensuring that Canada's researchers have the support they need to succeed. 
-	To make federal investments in third-party science and research more effective and principles-based, a new Strategic Science Fund will be the Government’s key tool to support third-party science and research organizations going forward. 
-	The Government has further supported science by making an investment of $4 billion to support the work of researchers and provide them access to the state-of-the-art tools and facilities they need.
Firms and innovators need a clear point of entry to a streamlined suite of relevant business innovation programs that meet their specific needs at different stages of growth. When looking at the suite of supports for business innovation, the Government has taken a new approach for how it is governed: 
-	The horizontal review of business innovation and clean technology programs across every federal department during 2017 resulted in an increase in overall funding for innovation support programs, along with a reduction in the number of separate business innovation programs—from 92 to about 35. The new suite of programs supports firms at all points on the innovation continuum. 
-	All of the federal programs in support of business innovation, as well as other government innovation supports from provinces and territories, are accessible through the Innovation Canada digital platform, which connects firms to the programs best suited to their needs.

Finally, the Government of Canada has adopted an experimental approach for ST&I governance, through the industry-led Supercluster Initiative. Each supercluster identifies cross-sector collaborative projects, and then provides funding and expert guidance for successful execution. The superclusters support all aspects of the innovation continuum by developing talent pools, encouraging greater business investment in R&D, strengthening supply chains and relationships between firms, and attracting anchor firms.","The policy debates surrounding Canada’s public research system take place within a context of broader science, technology and innovation priorities: skills development and retention; (co-)financing among partners, including provincial and territorial governments; private sector involvement and innovation; and organization and coordination models. There is ongoing desire to increase the number of professional, science and tech-related jobs in the Canadian economy as a share of total employment to 40% by 2025. To support this goal, the public research system both supports and relies on highly qualified personnel. Policy debates within this broader discussion include discussions around how to increase the proportion of under-represented groups, including women, and encourage their participation in Canada’s research systems. 

Funding of the research system, particularly of research infrastructure, is also an ongoing debate. Such debates centre on the appropriate roles at the federal, provincial and territorial, private sector, and institutional level and the corresponding funding responsibility to support Canada’s public research infrastructure. The importance of coordination and national cohesiveness is also prominent in Canada’s policy debates, focusing on the need to streamline services and functions to improve ease of access for researchers. Other prominent topics include the importance of facilitating open and collaborative science between academia, government, and the private sector to effectively maximize science and research outcomes, while ensuring that publicly-funded research infrastructure primarily benefits Canadian researchers.","The government is taking a horizontal approach to how it supports innovation and entrepreneurship across government, engaging a number of government departments and agencies through a more coordinated approach. This is best illustrated by the Innovation Canada digital platform, which connects firms to the programs best suited to their needs from federal, provincial and territorial governments. This support tackles a number of different issues, including:

-	Skills – To grow and scale-up, firms must be able to fill skills gaps, by gaining better access to global talent and recruiting from a broader, deeper pool of Canadians with strong STEM, business, creative, and digital skills. More work-integrated-learning placements are helping young Canadians learn the soft and technical skills they need to get their first jobs, and help firms to assess work-ready hires. The Global Skills Strategy also gives Canadian companies a faster and more predictable route to bring top talent and new skills from around the world to Canada.

-	Intellectual property – The Intellectual Property Strategy is making sure that Canadian businesses, creators, entrepreneurs and innovators have access to the best possible IP resources through IP awareness, education and advice; strategic IP tools for growth; and IP legislation. 

-	Funding – To help firms scale-up, a number of programs are working together to ensure a streamlined delivery of programs to companies as they move along the innovation continuum: the National Research Council-Industrial Research Assistance Program targets applied research and commercialization; Regional Development Agencies target scale-up and export; Innovation, Science and Economic Development's (ISED) Strategic Innovation Fund targets large-scale, later-stage funding; Global Affairs Canada's (GAC) Trade Commissioner Service targets international market linkages. Other programs, including the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada, are augmenting these flagship programs by increasing the availability of late-stage financing for innovative Canadian firms, and strengthening the Canadian VC ecosystem over the long term. 

-	Advisory support – GAC's Accelerated Growth Service provides high-potential companies with tailored support to help them access government programs and grow. In addition, with offices across Canada and in 161 cities around the world, the Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) provides Canadian businesses with on-the-ground intelligence, qualified contacts, partnership opportunities, and practical advice on foreign markets to help them make better, timely, and cost-effective decisions to achieve their goals abroad.","Beyond fostering and nurturing the generation of knowledge, one policy debate revolves around the balance between the rights of knowledge creators and opportunities for the knowledge users. On this front, Canada recently unveiled its Intellectual Property Strategy: over the next five years, the Government of Canada will be making sure that Canadian businesses, creators, entrepreneurs and innovators have access to the best possible IP resources through IP awareness, education and advice; strategic IP tools for growth; and IP legislation. Among others, the Intellectual Property Strategy is expected to make it easier for business to look for university-owned IP and associated opportunities. In parallel, the Government continues to make progress on promoting, developing and implementing Open Science under the 2018-2020 National Action Plan on Open Government. These Open Science initiatives encourage greater scientific openness and research accessibility for the benefit of Canadians. 

It has also been noted that the largest intellectual property and technology transfers from academia to Canadian companies occur when one of these innovative companies hires well-trained graduating students (testimony to the House of Commons Standing committee on Industry Science and Technology). However, in order to integrate the private sector, graduate students must be networked into the broader innovation ecosystem in order to do design work, proof of concept and prototyping. For this reason, the government supports a wide range of initiatives aimed at promoting work-integrated learning, collaborations and partnerships.","In an increasingly competitive global economy, cultivating a workforce with the skills industry needs is critical to Canada’s success. The federal government, through a number of departments and agencies, is committed to working with stakeholders, including industry, educators and workers, to identify solutions for addressing gaps in Canada’s talent ecosystem. Developing Canada’s talent pipeline is critical to achieving the country’s full potential as a leader in innovation and competitiveness. Recognizing the role of government in incentivizing private sector investment in workforce development, enhanced industry investment and commitment to training is required.  
-	Work-integrated learning - Stakeholders have advocated for work-integrated learning as an effective way to develop work-ready graduates, and strengthen linkages between industry and academia. Programs like Mitacs, CREATE, DS4Y and the Student Work Placement Program, provide young people with hands-on work-integrated learning opportunities. These opportunities better prepare students for the demands of the workforce, help them transition to the labour market, and better align learning with industry needs. 
-	Upskilling / Retraining - The upskilling of mid-career workers has been recognized as a measure to address the need for labour in high-demand sectors for growth and innovation, especially among SMEs that don't have the in-house capacity or infrastructure to find, assess and upskill workers with good potential to rapidly fill a sudden employment need. There is a growing need for agile, short-term, skill intensive training programs and work placements that can address the challenge of continuing education for mature professionals.
-	Foreign talent - Firms in high-growth sectors have identified a shortage of labour with the right skill sets to scale-up and grow their business. Access to global talent is seen as an integral part of the Global Skills Strategy, which helps Canadian firms recruit highly-trained foreign talent with in-demand skills. In addition, Canada is a top destination for students seeking both a high-quality international education and employment in their field of study once they graduate. With Canadian education credentials and skilled work experience in Canada, former international students are well positioned for success in applying for permanent residence through the Express Entry program.
-	Emerging technologies - Emerging and innovative technologies such as AI are crucial to growing a competitive, knowledge-based future economy. These technologies are also transforming the demand for skills and talent in Canada.
The issue of addressing labour shortages and skills mismatches is complex. While the Government of Canada has a number of programs in place, provincial and territorial partners and other organizations (e.g. employer associations, community-based organizations) also play a critical role. Despite a number of programs and initiatives, challenges remain in addressing key labour shortages and skills mismatches in an accurate, timely and effective way.
Future Skills (including the Future Skills Council and Centre) is part of the Government’s plan to ensure that Canada’s skills development policies and programs are prepared to meet jobseekers’, workers’ and employers’ changing needs. The Canadian Government has invested $225 million over four years, starting in spring 2018, and $75 million per year thereafter in the Future Skills plan to:
-	examine major trends that will have an impact on national and regional economies and workers;
-	identify emerging skills that are in demand now and into the future;
-	develop, test and evaluate new approaches to skills development; and
-	share results and best practices across public, private and not-for-profit sectors to support broader use of innovative approaches across Canada.
Future Skills includes a focus on addressing the needs of disadvantaged and under-represented groups, such as Indigenous people, persons with disabilities, low-income workers, newcomers to Canada and youth. This will help ensure that all Canadians can benefit from emerging opportunities.","Societies and economies are experiencing profound changes that involve economic transformation, such as new industrial geography, commercialization and privatization, technological revolutions in informatics and biotechnology, global climate change, and environmental degradation. All these shifts interact in complex ways and challenge our previous understanding of effective social, economic and environmental models. Canada is no exception.

In this context, many see innovation as a potential solution to some of society’s greatest sustainable development challenges. For Canada, this means supporting innovation projects with interconnected impacts that support the SDGs through partnership. It also means creating opportunities for Canadians to come together to share best practices, test creative ideas and measure their impact, catalyze action and achieve improved outcomes, with the aim of leaving no one behind.

Technological innovation and advancements are rapidly changing our understanding of what is possible at local, national and global levels. When considering challenges like achieving the SDGs, it is clear that new strategies and technologies are needed to achieve these collective goals. Many of Canada’s most important innovations for the SDGs will be initiated through direct community-level work, social entrepreneurship in the private sector, technological advancement or new efforts that provide the proof of concept that the public sector can take up, at scale.

Canada recognizes that integrated policy-making, at the federal level and across levels of government, is an important prerequisite for achieving the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. 

In mid-2019, following nationwide consultation, the Government of Canada released Towards Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy. Consistent with implementation plans developed by other countries, this interim document is a first step toward establishing the structures, processes and activities that need to be in place to move the 2030 Agenda forward in a coordinated, transparent and accountable manner. It also highlights the various actors involved and the partnerships, innovation and investment required to achieve these SDGs.

One targeted strategy to mobilize innovation to address societal challenges is Grand Challenges Canada (GCC). GCC is a platform for innovation for impact, primarily funded by the Government of Canada and other partners, that operates at the intersection of development, science/technology, and business sectors. GCC supports and enables the sustainable scaling of development innovations to overcome the “Pioneer Gap”- the persistent misalignment of the availability of investment capital and the economic realities of building businesses that serve low-income communities. The primary SDGs targeted by GCC's programs include: SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG4 (ECD for Girls and Boys), SDG5 (Gender Equality) and SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).",
Chile,"The Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation (Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología, Conocimiento e Innovación) started operations in October 2019. Its main mission is to promote and strengthen Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) derived from scientific-technological research and development. The Ministry is in charge of advising the President and collaborating in the design, formulation, coordination, implementation and evaluation of policies, plans and programs. 

The new Ministry is the governing body of the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation, ensuring the coordination, consistency and coherence of policies, plans and programs. It also promotes inter-ministerial and inter-regional coordination and collaboration, the development of joint initiatives within the public sector and public-private cooperation.","The main current debate focuses on allocating public budgets for research and development. There are ambitions and expectations, especially in the public research sector, to increase the R&D budget.

OECD 2017 statistics indicate that, while the average OECD Member Country allocated 2.37% of GDP as gross domestic expenditure on R&D, Chile’s level of investment reached only 0.36% of GDP. In 2017, Chilean human resources dedicated to R&D activities reached 16,620 people (2.01 per thousand employment). Chile is among the lowest performing OECD member countries in these research indicators, which implies a great challenge for the country. There is a consensus that R&D and innovation acts as an engine increasing productivity, economic growth and social development (especially in the long term). Investing in R&D is also recognised as a key determining factor of the country’s international competitiveness.","The Chilean R&D law allows a 35% deduction of R&D expenditures directly from corporate taxes (with an annual USD 1 million ceiling). Additionally, the remaining 65% is considered a necessary expenditure when calculating corporate income tax, which has a tax rate of 27%. This implies that if a company spends USD 100 in an R&D project, it will get back USD 52.55 in total tax deductions (USD 35 for the R&D tax credit and USD 17.55 for profit tax deductions).

Some actors in the private sector are requesting to render the acquisition small innovative firms (corporate venture capital) applicable for the R&D law as an investment in R&D. The Chilean Government, on the other hand, has concerns in having such a mechanism to boost innovation, i.e. approving this approach could introduce market distortions, benefitting particularly the wealthiest companies in Chile. This could encourage the so-called “killer acquisitions” (see Cunninghamy, Edererz and Max, 2019).

Instead, the Government is considering, among others, the following alternatives: (a) increasing the maximum tax-deductible amount; (b) enlarging the pool of eligible costs of necessary expenditures in R&D (e.g. administration and staff cost); and, (c) helping start-ups that have yet to make profits. The latter would entail changing the R&D law to give start-ups in cash what they would have received from the tax credit if they had made profits.","Within the innovation ecosystem, the need to create a pilot program to foster science- and technology-based enterprises is being discussed, as well as to continue strengthening hubs and Offices of Technology Licensing (OTLs). 

There is a low number of scientifically based technological research. Research projects seldom manage to reach markets (e.g. as academic spin-offs). The results for 2016 of the OTLs in ""training and consolidation programs"" show that the net number of technology-based enterprises was 8, very low in relation to the number of OTLs that existed in the country (29 OTLs) and also compared with international evidence. The average number of spinoffs in Chile per OTL was only 0.28 in 2016. Meanwhile, in Europe the average number of spin-offs created was 1.6 per OTL for that same year.","The training of advanced human resources for research and innovation and their insertion in industry are some of the central axes for national innovation policies in Chile. There are several programs for the formation of advanced human capital, such as the state scholarships provided through the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT). CONICYT also offers programs to encourage the insertion of PhDs and master’s graduates in industry, such as the Program for the Attraction and Insertion of Human Capital in Industry (PAI).

Despite these efforts, Chile is the OECD member country with the fewest researchers per thousand workers; with 1.01 per thousand labour force against the OECD average of 7.7. In the case of companies that conduct R&D, they declare that on average 2.3% of employees are engaged in R&D activities. In addition, they point out that on average only 0.14% of the company's personnel are doctors while 0.24% have a master's degree. Regarding the occupational situation of the PhD graduates from programmes with a scholarship granted by CONICYT, 92.1% are employed (including employees or self-employed workers), of which 82% are working in universities and 6.5% in companies (public or private). The data show that, in Chile, the main source of work for doctorate-holders are universities.

The discussion in Chile focuses on the fact that there is low demand for advanced human capital in companies. While CONICYT programs such as Attraction and Insertion of Advanced Human Capital Program (PAI) have attempted to address this, companies have demonstrated limited interest and take-up. For this reason, studies are being conducted within the Ministry of Economy to make these programs more effective, taking as an example the experiences of countries such as Finland with its program Post Docs in Companies (PoDoCo) or France with its program of Industrial Agreements for the Training of Researchers (CIFRE).","One of the main policy debates around how national policy for research and innovation can help address societal challenges is the need of setting a long-term STI policy. Historically, each government has designed its own policies, changing back and forwards from horizontal policies to strategic sectors. One important step to promote a long-term approach to research and innovation was the recommendation by the National Council on Innovation for Development (CNID) in 2017 to focus on grand challenges. This approach has received more consensus across the political spectrum and it gives space for different priorities.

So far, the government has framed the main challenges to be pursued, defining them along with the appropriate policy responses. The main challenges defined are Climate Change and Natural Disasters, an Ageing Population and the Technological Revolution. To address prioritised challenges, the government has used existing policy tools, designed new instruments and programs and worked on a long-term policy strategy.

In particular, the government identified existing programs that could be used to start working on mission-ortiented policy: (a) FONDEF-CONICYT (funding for applied research); (b) Bienes Públicos - CORFO (funding for public goods provision); and, (c) FIC-R (funds for innovation in regional governments). It also has worked on the design of new programs that could be more adequate for a mission-oriented approach: (a) Vanguardia (associated and ""transformational"" research); (b) Challenge Prizes; (c) Technological Centers; and, (d) Science-based entrepreneurship.",
China,"Highly ranked issues in the Governance agenda include improving the allocation mode of science and technology resources, making full use of various economic resources, and improving the efficiency of science and technology inputs and outputs. 

Since 2014, the Chinese government has successively introduced several programmes related to the reform of the S&T system, which have been welcomed by the majority of scientific and technological workers. These programmes include ""the plan to deepen the management reform of the central financial science and technology plan (special projects, funds, etc.)"", the ""implementation plan to deepen the reform of the science and technology system"", the ""several opinions on increasing knowledge value-oriented distribution policy"", and the ""guiding opinions on the promotion of classified personnel evaluation mechanism reform"". In March 2018, the State Council integrated the responsibilities of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, and re-established the Ministry of Science and Technology as a component of the State Council.","A key priority in China is the construction of science and technology innovation centres and national laboratories to strengthen national strategic scientific and technological strengths and continuously improve the national innovation system. Other priorities include strengthening the construction of independent innovation teams, improve the integration of scientific research resources, improve the collaborative innovation mechanism with universities, research institutes, enterprises, and the government, maximising the advantages of all aspects, and form an overall joint force to promote scientific and technological innovation.
The governance system needs to explore the establishment of an efficient and coordinated innovation system, accelerate the pace of scientific and technological system reform, and foster a good innovation pattern combining production, education, and research, integrating upstream, midstream, and downstream, and coordinating large and small enterprises. The system should also integrate national innovation resources, establish a new operating mechanism of goal-oriented, performance management, collaborative research, and open sharing, and build breakthrough-type, lead-based, and platform-type national laboratories. These laboratories should work with other types of research institutions, universities, enterprise R&D institutions, in order to form a new pattern of collaborative innovation with complementary functions and healthy interaction.

Relevant departments have recently formulated and promulgated documents aimed at expanding scientific research-related autonomy of universities and research institutes, to strengthen and optimise the layout of governmental research institutes and to increase stable support for basic research institutes. Research institutes have also formulated institutional charters to ensure their independent management and operation.
A key challenge is the tendency towards short-term research, which makes it difficult to produce real innovations. The Chinese government aims to address this challenge by revising various evaluation mechanisms. Activities include further advancing the reform of science and technology evaluation, implementing the reform and deployment of project evaluation and organisation evaluation, and accelerating the establishment of a classification and evaluation system oriented to the quality, contribution, and performance of scientific and technological innovation. These reforms should break the tendency of ""only papers, only professional titles, only academic qualifications, and only awards"", adhering to the combination of evaluation and use, and strengthen the dominant position of talent evaluation by employers.

Besides reforming evaluation mechanisms, scientific research integrity mechanisms should be improved. Activities include the construction of a research integrity information system covering the whole country and increasing the amount of investigation and punishment of violations and research misconduct. 

To improve the efficiency of scientific and technological resources in the public research system, China should adhere to the policy of “innovating mechanisms, revitalizing existing stocks, integrating and perfecting, and opening and sharing.” The country needs to improve the policy and institutional environment, strengthening the working mechanism and management system, building linked with local and regional departments, and promoting open sharing pilots in key regions and departments. Furthermore, an open sharing operation mechanism should be explored, while also strengthening supervision and evaluation and information disclosure.

The construction of policies and regulations has been continuously strengthened to optimise the open and sharing institutional environment for scientific and technological resources. The Chinese government seeks to promote the open sharing of large-scale scientific instruments and facilities composing the national S&T infrastructure, to serve STI actors, the economy and society as a whole. In 2017, related departments have introduced the ""Measures for the Management of Scientific Data"" to strengthen the standardised management of scientific data and promote a shared utilisation system.","In 2018, the Chinese government launched a pilot policy to promote angel investment and venture capital investment. It introduced various tax measures, such as improving the fixed asset accelerated depreciation policy, increasing the pre-tax deduction limit for general corporate employee education funds from 2.5% to 8%, extending the period for carrying forward corporate losses and improving the research expense deduction policy. The government allowed enterprises to entrust overseas research and development expenses to benefit from the pre-tax deduction policy. It increased the deduction rate from 50% to 75%, further motivating enterprises to increase investment in research and development, and supporting technological innovation.

For the first time in 2017, the government issued a technology-based SME standard at the national level, which increased the deduction rate for technology-based SMEs from 50% to 75%. A total of 84 000 technology-based SMEs nationwide enjoy preferential policies for R&D expenses plus deductions, accounting for 51.9% of enterprises enjoying preferential policies for R&D expenses plus deductions, and a reduction of 37.5 billion yuan in corporate income tax. At the same time, the government has completed the construction of the information service platform for technology-based SMEs and officially launched the independent evaluation service for technology-based SMEs.

Another area of significant activity concerns improving the intellectual property (IP) service system to form stable innovation expectation, and to effectively protect the initiative spirit of the participants of innovation. This includes reinforcing enforcement and introducing a punitive compensation system to fundamentally solve the outstanding issues that restrict IP protection, such as inconsistent judgment standards, geographical protection and complex litigation procedures. Such measures are expected to improve the incentive mechanism to encourage innovation from the perspective of the system and the direction of public opinion, establish a fair competition atmosphere, create a good environment for innovation, and respect those who dare to innovate. A stronger IP service system will accelerate the establishment of an academic integrity system and conduct zero tolerance for academic misconduct. It will also stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit, mobilize the enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and innovation in the whole society, promoting innovation and development.","In view of problems in the knowledge transfer and sharing system, it is necessary to implement and improve the policies for transforming scientific and technological achievements as soon as possible so that scientific and technological achievements can be allocated according to economic needs. The following measures are required:

1)	Break down regional barriers, reduce administrative intervention, and form a nationally unified, internally and externally integrated transfer and transformation market, so that scientific and technological achievements can flow freely in the market.

2)	Promote the reform of mixed ownership of scientific and technological achievements, promoting the joint ownership of property rights of scientific and technological achievements with those individuals or teams responsible, through agreed methods.

3)	Strengthen the specialisation of labour around the value chain of knowledge flows, fostering a group of specialised knowledge-operation institutions, and promoting the deep integration of technology and capital, and technology and industry. Also improve over-the-counter trading channels such as personnel mobility, education and training, in order to promote the transfer of tacit knowledge.

4)	Beyond state-owned asset preservation and appreciation, conduct classified management assessment based on the properties of intangible assets, simplify the existing management process of scientific and technological intangible assets and strengthen the implementation and connection of policies for the transfer of scientific and technological achievements, such as technology shares and personnel incentives.
In 2018, the National Technology Transfer Demonstration Agency continued to explore new mechanisms and new models of technology transfer services based on market demand. The government provides enterprises with technology, talents, and financial services through new organisations such as the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Industrial Alliance. With the continuous deepening of technology transfer services, the demonstration institutions have put more emphasis on common technology research and development and achievement transformation, accelerating the industrialisation process of technological achievements. They also put more emphasis on supporting market-oriented mechanisms, full-chain services, capitalisation approaches, network support, and internationalisation.","Another set of priorities include improving the mode of talent training. Talent policies need to be improved and education needs to be further reformed to better cultivate young people's awareness and ability to innovate. It is also necessary to mobilise talents and establish more flexible talent management mechanisms, to deepen education reform, to promote quality education and innovative education methods, and to improving the quality of talent training. The aim is to form an educating environment conducive to the growth of innovative talents. 
The education systems needs to stimulate the creative energy of talents, and vigorously train and bring up a large number of strategic scientific and technological talents, scientific and technological leaders, young scientific and technological talents and high-level innovation teams with global vision and international standards. Another priority is taking the ""double first-class"" construction of first-class universities and first-class disciplines as an important content of priority education development. At the same time, it is necessary to create innovation environments that respect personality and tolerate failure.","In past decades, STI policies for social development has been relatively neglected, compared with those for economic growth. More recently, many projects have been initiated or started to redress this imbalance, including the S&T Benefiting the People project in 2012; and the National Innovation Demonstration Zone for the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda in 2017.",
Colombia,"Colombia is currently having important debates around the governance of its national framework for Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy. At the centrepiece is the creation of the STI Ministry, its role on designing and formulating STI policies and improving institutional governance. The Ministry is being created within the transformation of Colciencias, Colombia’s main STI funding agency. Another key discussion focuses on the role of a National Council of STI, as an instance of consultation and definition of policies (currently the Advisory Council for STI leads this role). The country is carrying out an Expert Committee known as the ""Misión de Sabios"", composed of 47 experts in the public and private sector working on research and development activities. There are eight thematic focuses to propose the roadmap for STI and Education for the next 25 years.

Regarding governance, the current articulation between the National STI policy framework and the Competitiveness and Innovation policy framework has been discussed. This includes instances of coordination and complementarity, as well as the articulation of Departmental (regional governments) science policies and plans with available technology and innovation capacities. Another key discussion is the role of the Departmental Councils of STI in identifying challenges, setting priorities and the allocation of resources following such priorities.","The current national strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) has a territorial approach, arising from the “STI Pact” from the 2018-2022 National Development Plan. This document proposes an increase in research and development investment of 1.5% of GDP by 2022 (doubling the investment). This implies seeking the sustainability of STI resources, both from current sources such as that of the General Royalty System’s (SGR) STI Fund (SGR-FCTeI), as well as the search for new sources.

There is currently a proposal for reforming the SGR-FCTeI. Through this fund, the government has established the Bicentennial Doctoral Grants and allocated resources for the institutional strengthening of higher education institutions. These new instruments have supported public research institutes to generate knowledge and technologies of public interest. A need has been identified to review how these programs have performed and redesign them accordingly.","The main discussions centre around: (i) innovation and support for productivity in the manufacturing and service sectors; (ii) promoting the bio-economy, the digital transformation and industries 4.0; and, (iii) business innovation systems for small and medium enterprises.

In addition, ongoing discussions are taking place around revising the design of funding programs and instruments to better address companies’ needs, the expansion of access to tax benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises and the management and the creation of capital funds. Key opportunities have been identified for seed funding and risk guarantees, particularly for the spin-off and technology-based entrepreneurship policy in specific sectors, such as the creative economy (Economía Naranja), particularly within the agricultural sector.","The current debates are oriented to the design and implementation of policy strategies boosting linkages between companies, universities and the public sector. This includes the design of financing programs and instruments and the consolidation of technology transfer offices and technologies for the productive and social sector. Other policy areas of attention are the design of international technology transfer programs for small and medium-sized enterprises and the commercialisation of intellectual property research results and products from university-business negotiation processes.","The main discussion centres on the update of the high-level education policy, with particular attention to PhD and research-oriented master’s programs. A specific area being explored is the creation of programs helping the insertion of PhDs in companies and public and territorial entities. Tax benefits are being contemplated for companies that link personnel with doctorates and research masters.

Additionally, the role of emerging technologies and their influence on education and training in permanent learning systems has been debated. In particular, questioning to what extent the country should continue financing the training of doctors in all areas of knowledge or if certain ones should start being prioritized. Likewise, another discussion is exploring the ability for the Colombian national STI system to welcome human capital graduating at the doctoral level.","Key areas of debate are the importance of the formulation of mission-oriented policies, programs facing societal challenges and the implementation of experimental programs. Other areas of policy being discussed include: 
(i)	the incorporation of new technologies and emerging technologies; 
(ii)	to improve the production and income of farmers in the agricultural sector; 
(iii)	the implementation of open and competitive calls for research and development, which define program areas, challenges and program financing related to the Sustainable Development Goals; and, 
(iv)	how to generate a more inclusive and sustainable science system.",
Costa Rica,"There are two main ongoing policy debates: 

1)	The creation of a new innovation agency to improve Costa Rica's STI governance that efficiently shapes policy design, implementation, delivery and evaluation. At the beginning of October 2019 the country engaged in a legislative process to reform its National Council for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICIT) into a Research and Innovation Agency. If the bill is approved, the new Agency will be responsible for the implementation of different national instruments and programs that aim to boost research, innovation, human capital and start-ups. 

2)	The country has undertaken a debate about digital technologies in the context of the so-called fourth industrial revolution (4IR). To move forward in this regard, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications (MICITT) launched in October 2018 the Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 4.0. This strategy contains the country’s vision and proposes the lines of actions needed to drive Costa Rican society towards the new digital economy and to address country challenges, by making a better use of digital technologies in the government, the private sector and society as a whole. 4IR requires new approaches in practically all STI policies. Chambers of commerce, ministries and civil society recently started debating the governance of this transformation.","There is an ongoing debate about the Higher Education Fund (Fondo Especial para la Educación Superior Pública, FEES), which finances public universities. Costa Rican fiscal problems puts pressure for the reduction in costs and accountability for the allocation of these universities resources, which are mainly invested in day-to-day expenses and salaries for teaching. These expenses are defined by law, thus the reduction in FEES would primarily affect the allocation of funds for R&D. 

Another debate is about appropriate incentives for researchers that support industry needs. Traditionally, incentives in public universities have focalised in academic outputs (e.g. publications). Changing them requires important modifications in internal regulations of universities, which implies a lengthy process of discussion and analysis.","There are two main ongoing policy debates: 

1)	Financing start-ups and SMEs in biotechnology, nanotechnology and convergent technologies that requires long-term support while current instruments allow allocations for only two or three years. As a possible solution, ongoing discussions are exploring linking or concatenating different existing funds. This could support the long-term funding requirement for this kind of projects.

2)	The process in which entrepreneurs, SMEs and other actors apply for public funds. In particular, how to simplify the process despite a complicated regulatory framework which is difficult to improve. For example, several regulations consider only SMEs, excluding other kinds of actors in agriculture or the creative economy.","The main ongoing debate has focused on how to improve the link between the academic sector (universities and other public and private research centres) and the private sector. Factors associated with the regulatory framework and institutional regulations of academia have hindered such links. Although in the past years all public universities had created technology transfer offices, the regulations established in these offices are not necessarily known by the academic community and even less so by industry actors. 

The Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications (MICITT) is currently carrying out an analysis to allow characterising the barriers to technology transfer and commercialization in Costa Rica. This, with a view to implement pilot projects aiming to find alternatives that help resolve these obstacles. In parallel, the Export Promotion Agency of Costa Rica (PROCOMER) is conducting a study to map the available technological services and research infrastructure in the field of life sciences and medical devices.","One of the main discussions around this topic focuses on the reskilling of our human talent to new areas of knowledge, which are being developed worldwide or that will require life-long learning processes. The discussion emphasizes the role of the Costa Rica’s National Institute for Learning (INA) and its capacities to respond to the requirements of companies to these trends. In particular, the debate centres on the sorts of training that should be provided. Promoted skills should provide people with low academic qualification opportunities to add value and successfully address emerging needs of companies. Universities also need to align their academic programs with these needs to meet the demand of human resources for the knowledge economy. 
The main government initiatives in 2018-2019 are: 
-	Loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) for Innovation and Human Capital Development: specialised reskilling training for innovations projects in areas such as cybersecurity, IoT, AI, big data, and analytics.
-	The dual vocational education and training bill: on September 2019, the Costa Rican Parliament approved a dual vocational education and training bill. The legal framework will impact enterprises, students and workers who require learning new skills and abilities in a practical and agile way.","Since the publication in 2017 of the “Knowledge based Society and Economy National Policy” by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications (MICITT), R&D&I policies have had an alignment with social development goals (SDGs), focusing in Grand Challenges. The recent “Digital Transformation National Strategy and the Bioeconomy National Strategy” to be published early in 2020 will also pursue the articulation of national and international efforts to attend global challenges by intensifying cooperation. In this area, another notable strategy published in 2019 is the “National Plan of Decarbonization”. 

The “Bioeconomy National Strategy” is a joint effort between four Ministries, i.e. led by MICITT with the participation of the Ministry of Environment and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestocks and the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade. This strategy recognizes that the bioeconomy provides a basis for productive transformation in Costa Rica, through the application of knowledge for:
-	Increasing value added in the agricultural, aquaculture and fishing, forestry and agro-industrial sectors;
-	Processing waste and residues from the agricultural, aquaculture and fishing, forestry and agro-industrial sectors;
-	Diversifying production and encouraging the development of new value chains; and,
-	Sophisticating national production, with a sustainable use of resources offered by the Costa Rican biodiversity and the application of knowledge in the field of biological sciences.

The strategy establishes that the bioeconomy offers Costa Rica the opportunity to make a big leap towards sustainability, reconciling objectives of productive development and environmental protection, and the sustainable use of our biological wealth.",
Croatia,"This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Several important strategic documents on research and innovation were adopted in 2014, including the National Innovation Strategy; the Strategy for Education, Science and Technology; and the Croatian Research and Innovation Infrastructures Roadmap. The Smart Specialisation Strategy (S3 Strategy) was adopted in 2016. These strategic documents form the basis for the governance of the Croatian national innovation system. In keeping with the S3 Strategy, Croatia is in the process of establishing a National innovation Council, whose role will be to monitor the implementation of the measures envisaged under the different strategies. One of the main governance challenges facing Croatia is the lack of monitoring, resulting in a lack of continuous co-ordination and co-operation between the implementing bodies at different levels.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

An ongoing discussion pertains to finding new funding models for the Croatian research and development (R&D) system. National investment in R&D is rather low; most of the funds serve to pay researchers’ salaries. Another challenge for the R&D system resides in the lax conditions for scientific advancement, leading to a rather large number of young researchers in high scientific positions. To secure more funds for research, the Ministry of Science and Innovation has introduced multi-annual contracts signed with public research organisations (PROs). The contracts stipulate that the Ministry distributes part of the research budget based on the research performance of the PROs.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The previous law stipulating R&D support for companies through R&D tax incentives was in force until 31 December 2014. Since then, no such measure promoting R&D activities exists in Croatia, and businesses has insisted that it be reintroduced. Now that EU funds have opened up access to financing, the business community has suggested that the grant process be more user-friendly, simple and fast, so that companies can use the funds more efficiently.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The current debate on knowledge transfer relates to the sustainability of technology-transfer offices (TTOs), which are the most important links between academia and industry. A major problem is that TTOs experience a high turnover of skilled experts, which is the result of uncertain funding at both the national and institutional levels.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

One of the main challenges facing the national research system is how to create a stable model for recruiting early-career researchers. Another challenge is how to promote intersectoral mobility between academia and other sectors. As things now stand, researchers who are recruited into the public sector/academia are more prone to remain in academia for their entire career. Shorter periods of international and/or intersectoral mobility could be envisaged for younger researchers.",[Left blank],
Cyprus,"A new Research and Innovation (R&I) governance system was established in October 2018, following its formal adoption by the Council of Ministers. The new system responds to the need for an integrated and effective governance for the design and implementation of national R&I strategies and policies. It has the main aim for R&I to become a key driver for economic growth, competitiveness and social prosperity. The system includes new institutions and bodies, such as the National Board for Research and Innovation (NBRI), the Chief Scientist and the Ministerial R&I Coordinators' Committee. The Directorate of Research, Innovation and Life Long Learning, part of the Directorate General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development (DG ECPD), is in charge of R&I policy and provides support to the Chief Scientist and the NBRI. It also assists for the design and coordination of R&I policy issues and coordinates, supports and monitors the implementation of the national R&I Strategy. The Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) is the government’s executive arm for R&I. 

Furthermore, the Government of Cyprus has prepared a draft legislation for the establishment of a Deputy Ministry for Innovation and Digital Policy. According to the draft legislation, the Deputy Ministry's competences relevant to R&I are the following: (i) design, coordinate and implement the national R&I strategy and supervise the operations of the national R&I governance system; (ii) promote start-ups and digital entrepreneurship; and, (iii) provide guidance and supervise the RIF. The draft legislation was approved by the Council of Ministers and was transmitted to the House of Representatives for its final adoption. The Government aims for the Deputy Ministry to be established and become operational in January 2020.","The Cyprus R&I Strategy Framework that was adopted by the National Board for Research and Innovation (NBRI) in May 2019. It aims to act as a driver for strengthening Cyprus' economy and for becoming a regional hub in the fundamental areas of research, scientific excellence, innovation and technological development. It defines appropriate fields of action to support the achievement of national objectives and promotes investments in the medium- and longer-term. The R&I Strategy Framework revolves around three principal strategic pillars: (i) Research Excellence; (ii) knowledge transfer and commercial exploitation; and (iii) Innovative Entrepreneurship. Furthermore, six horizontal pillars act as enablers of strategic importance: (i) governance, (ii) the National R&I Strategy; (iii) cultural change; (iv) international linkages; (v) communication and diffusion; and, (vi) the digital transformation. The Strategy Framework is implemented through a set of policy measures and activities targeting the aforementioned strategic pillars and enablers, kick-starting the reform of the national R&I system and facilitating a strong boost of the research and innovation ecosystem. More information on the actions that are included in each pillar/enabler is available at NBRI’s website (www.nbri.gov.cy).","One of the main strategic pillars of the 2019-23 Cyprus R&I Strategy Framework is Innovative Entrepreneurship. The objective of this particular pillar is to 'develop a favourable environment for technological development and innovate entrepreneurship'. The framework includes, inter alia, measures aiming to foster the R&I conducted by enterprises. 

Moreover, the majority of the programmes and schemes included in the Action Plan of the Cyprus’s Smart Specialisation Strategy (S3CY) seek to stimulate the involvement of the private sector in R&I activities and to nurture closer links between the enterprises and universities & research institutes. These programmes have been implemented by the Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) via the RESTART 2016-20 Framework Programme. 

Furthermore, a recent revision of the Income Tax Law provides incentives aiming to foster investments in start-ups and innovative companies in Cyprus. In parallel, the start-up visa scheme aims to attract start-ups from non-EU countries to relocate in Cyprus and enhance the start-up ecosystem. Finally, the creation of spin-offs and the participation of public universities in legal entities is being promoted via the recent revision of the legislation governing the operations of the two main public universities (University of Cyprus and Cyprus University of Technology).","One of the strategic pillars of the Cyprus 2019-23 R&I Strategy Framework is Knowledge Transfer and Commercial Exploitation. The objective of this pillar is to enhance knowledge transfer among the science community, the public sector, the business sector and society as a whole. In particular, it will facilitate the commercial exploitation of new knowledge and technology, aiming at developing competitive and value-added products, services and processes and also support social innovation. The framework includes, inter alia, measures aiming to strengthen linkages and collaborations among the academia and the public and private sectors. 

Moreover, several programmes and schemes included in the Action Plan of the Cyprus’s Smart Specialisation Strategy (S3CY) seek to support linkages between research and businesses. These have been implemented by the Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) via the RESTART 2016-20 Framework Programme. 

Furthermore, the establishment of a Central Knowledge Transfer Office is under preparation. Specialized Knowledge Transfer Offices (KTOs) typically support knowledge transfer in academic and research-performing organisations. KTOs are responsible for technology transfer and other aspects of the commercialization of research that takes place within the organisation. They engage in a variety of activities facilitating the process of bringing research findings to markets, often acting as a channel or ‘bridge’ between academia and industry. Within this context, KTOs establish collaboration channels with enterprises and the industry at the local and international level, aiming to perform a match between technologies developed at the research organisation and the real needs of the industry and to improve local SMEs’ access to innovation. The Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) is developing a central Knowledge Transfer Office aiming to address the need for a fully-functional, established support facility in Cyprus to support academic and research-performing organisations in knowledge transfer activities. The objectives of the Office will be: (i) to stimulate cost-efficient and effective knowledge transfer across universities and main research-performing organisations; and, (ii) to catalyse the breakdown of barriers across the national innovation ecosystem. The development of the central Knowledge Transfer Office (KTO) will coordinate and enhance knowledge transfer activity in Cyprus and will facilitate achieving a critical mass of researchers and research outputs served by the facility, supporting sustainability and high-level services for the KTO. 

The University-Industry Liaison Offices Network has proved successful and thus it continues to enhance the employability of future graduates through internships in businesses.","Key priorities include promoting, recognizing and rewarding research excellence. Developing a critical mass of high-quality human capital for science and technology will enable the development of cutting-edge technologies and boost research performance at institutional and national levels.
For the enhancement of the human resources capacity in the Cypriot R&I sector, a number of measures need to be tackled: including (i) the improvement of the framework regarding the recruitment and employment policies and conditions for researchers; (ii) the promotion of mechanisms for career development of academic / research staff on the basis of excellence; (iii) the attraction of talent from abroad through the availability of high-quality research infrastructures; and (iv) the availability of an attractive institutional and legislative framework.","R&I can bring together resources and knowledge across different fields, technologies and disciplines, including social sciences and the humanities that will help address major concerns shared by citizens in Europe and elsewhere. These concerns or challenges are mostly related to the sectors of health, transport, energy as well as essential parts of the Sustainable Developments Goals including the environment and climate change, inclusive and innovative society and freedom.

Regarding economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection, these are all crucial elements of the Smart Specialisation Strategy of Cyprus (S3CY). This strategy aims to promote knowledge and innovation, the rational use of available resources and to achieve high employment rates as means to enhance socio-economic development and cohesion. Within the framework of the S3CY, the following sectors have been identified as the main priorities: Tourism, Energy (particularly solar energy, , energy storage and transfer), Agriculture and Food Industry, Construction , Transportation and Health. In addition, the environment (particularly issues such as climate change, pollution, eco–innovation and water resources) and the ICT were defined as important horizontal sectors. The Strategy is implemented through an Action Plan including various measures supporting sustainable development. Examples of such measures are the social innovation programme and the participation in Joint Programmes Initiatives.

Cyprus has only recently initiated a process of establishing a mechanism for monitoring the implementation and mainstreaming of SDGs into national policies. This task has been assigned to the Directorate General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development (DG EPCD). Within 2019, DG EPCD has prepared a proposal for the creation of a monitoring mechanism that includes the creation of specialised units within each ministry. Currently, as a first step, there is an ongoing process of mapping the status of current and relevant national policies, strategies, measures and statistical monitoring in place. A second step will involve locating possible needs, gaps or weaknesses in these policies. In the near future, Cyprus aims not only to engage in a multi-stakeholder dialogue, but also to conduct training sessions and to prepare a comprehensive communication strategy for promoting SDG awareness across government officials and civil society.",
Czech Republic,"In the Czech Republic, competences in the research, development and innovation (RDI) support system and its governance are defined by the Act No. 130/2002 Coll., on the “Support of Research, Experimental Development and Innovation from Public Funds and on Amendments to Some Related Acts”, which came into force and effect in 2002. This Act has been amended several times, and in 2018, another technical amendment was drafted, addressing primarily the change in approach towards the assessment of research organisations. This draft amendment, which was prepared by the main actors in RDI system under the coordination of the RDI Council, was approved by the Government in May 2019 and submitted for further legislative procedures. 

Preparing this technical amendment has highlighted a need for comprehensive changes in the legislation underpinning the RDI support system. The available scope for technical amendments provides too little room for thorough reform, e.g. on the need for a new approach to boosting innovation support, which are subsequently set aside. However, these broader issues are now included in the debate on preparing a follow-up amendment of a larger scope to the law. This is currently one of the main issue of policy debate on the “National Research, Development and Innovation Policy of the Czech Republic 2021+”.

Policy discussions also focus on other RDI policy-making areas of high importance, notably the overall level of RDI expenditure, where the Czech Republic is approaching the EU average, because of rising expenditures in recent years. However, to ensure the benefits of this investment arise, it is necessary to properly implement and combine different tools and sources of RDI funding, both of a public and private nature. Also discussed is a proposal on how to increase the share of institutional support for the long-term strategic development of research organisations. 

Besides public resources for RDI, the private sector plays an important role, accounting for more than half of the total expenditure on RDI in the Czech Republic. The government aims to set conditions that will motivate enterprises, mainly SMEs and start-ups, to make even larger investments in RDI, through its policy measures of both direct and indirect RDI support.","The Czech Republic’s RDI environment has seen significant change over the past decade. Financial resources raised from the European Structural and Investment Funds have significantly contributed to the development of the research and innovation ecosystem, strengthening research and innovation infrastructure, capacities and capabilities for excellent RDI in both public and private sectors. Since 2017, evaluation of research organisations has broadened from a purely RDI performance-based assessment to a comprehensive evaluation, taking into account also the governance, long-term strategy development and socio-economic benefits and impacts of research organisations (new methodology M2017+). 

In the ""Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic 2019-2030"", which the Government adopted in 2019, one of the main objectives is to strengthen the innovation chain: basic research -> applied research -> innovation -> product -> profits -> reinvestment in research. These measures include, inter alia, strengthening the institutional component of research organisations‘ public funding based on excellence, and strengthening targeted support to those research institutions whose RDI results are applied in practice. Another goal is to focus much more on an increased participation in the EU Framework Programmes, in particular in the forthcoming Horizon Europe.","Although Czech innovation performance is growing, the country is weak in protecting intellectual property and in investing venture capital in new companies, especially in start-ups. The Czech RDI system lags in its availability of venture capital investments for innovative entrepreneurship. The underdeveloped venture capital market is identified as the biggest obstacle. According to some opinions, the lack of interest in investing venture capital can also be explained by the lack of a tradition of venture capital investing and a complex legislative background. The formation of appropriate conditions and incentives for investing in start-ups and spin-offs is an area ripe for government support to innovative entrepreneurship. The government aims to establish an environment where the state with its tools will support the most risky period of emergence of new companies.","Despite significant increase in public and private spending on RDI and an increase in joint publications in recent years, there remains a lack of long-term cooperation between the research and application sectors in the Czech Republic compared with other EU Member States. Both sectors operate to a large extent separately and independently of one another.

To improve the use of knowledge from public research in enterprise innovation, it is essential to streamline the dissemination and sharing of knowledge from research organisations, and to improve the operation of technology transfer centers operating in public research organisations, by increasing their efficiency. To enhance the effectiveness of cooperation between the academic and application spheres, it is also necessary to maximise the use of intellectual property rights tools. 

Research in enterprises in the Czech Republic is ""pulled"", especially by companies with foreign ownership. Domestic companies often act as subcontractors to foreign companies, and their research activities and the ability to innovate, in comparison to foreign enterprises, is typically limited. Domestic enterprises need to further develop their research and development activities so that their competitiveness is based not on cheap labour, but on the application of new knowledge and products that offer higher added value, especially in emerging technologies, such as nanotechnologies, information and communication technology, biotechnology, etc. The challenge for the future is the ability not only to discover and develop the knowledge and the product at home, but also to use and sell them in such a way that much of the value added would remain in the domestic economy.","The Czech Republic has been implementing the ""Action Plan for Development of Human Resources for Research, Development and Innovation and Gender Equality in Research, Development and Innovation in the Czech Republic for the years 2018-2020"" (hereinafter referred to as ""HR Action Plan""), which was approved by the Government in 2018. The HR Action Plan addresses a wide range of human resources development issues, including gender equality and diversity.

Given the already apparent lack of high-quality researchers and skilled professionals, the main goal in this area is to ensure the availability of a sufficient number of top-class researchers and highly qualified experts on management positions in the corporate sector. The dynamic growth of the research and innovation system in the Czech Republic means it is necessary to further improve the quality of human resources in RDI. It is necessary to stimulate research organisations using appropriate tools to improve the quality of researchers, e.g. through career plans, lifelong learning, etc. The development of competencies that are needed for the management of scientific work (managerial positions) also need to be supported.

To improve the quality of human resources for RDI and management positions in companies, it is necessary to constantly improve the quality of master and doctoral studies, particularly in relation to key/future emerging technological fields and socioeconomic challenges. Emphasis should be placed mainly on ensuring a sufficient supply of graduates with a quality education in science and technology, and on improving the quality of training programmes in the humanities and social sciences. Czech universities should also be stimulated to offer more attractive master and doctoral programmes for international students.","The support of innovation for societal well-being and cohesion have already been reflected, among others, in the strategic framework „Czech Republic 2030”, which was adopted in 2017 and in which the chapter „People and Society“ focuses on social issues and the quality of life of citizens in all regions of the Czech Republic. These questions are related to family, community, labour, equality, education, health and culture.

In 2019, the ”Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic 2019-2030“ was approved by the Government, in which the actual needs for research, innovation and society are emphasized. In this context, the Czech Republic has exceptional technical potential, with capable engineers and technicians. The new technological and socioeconomic challenges call for a more efficient system of polytechnic education, new ways of teaching, digital education, etc. To help prepare the young generation for their future professional lives, either inside or outside the RDI sector, state budget expenditures and European Structural and Investment Funds aim to support the most promising RDI centres and research infrastructures, both of international and innovation importance. 

Support in the area of societal challenges will be strengthened for endogenous Czech companies, spin-offs and start-ups arising as a result both of academic research and of the natural needs of businesses in all areas of social needs. The quality of citizens' lives will also be improved by the digitalisation of public administration services. This will offer the possibility for citizens to provide their data to the public administration just once and to interact with it at a single point.",
Denmark,"The former Danish government published in 2017 a strategy called “Denmark – Ready to seize future opportunities”. In the strategy, the former government outlined its objectives for future research and innovation, including strengthening technological research, reviewing the allocation of research funding to the universities, and exploring how to create better career opportunities for (young) researchers. 

A new government took office in 2019. It acknowledges that education and research play a central role in identifying solutions to major societal challenges. Thus, among other things, it is the government’s ambition to strengthen research, safeguard freedom of research, and fulfil the Barcelona target, so that public investment in research reaches a minimum 1% of GDP. Also high on the government’s agenda is gender equality in order to enhance the talent pool. 

However, the most central issue, which continues to be debated, are the environment/environmental challenges, and the Danish government has proposed an overall target of reducing greenhouse gases in 2030 by 70% compared to 1990 levels. This target is supported by a majority of the Danish political parties, and is expected to be part of an upcoming act on climate. An example of how the focus on the environment affects research is the latest agreement on the distribution of the research reserve. The research reserve is a minor part of the public's total investment in research and this year the total sum of money was 1.925 billion DKK. From the total sum, the parliament prioritised 1.5 billion DKK to the theme of green transition. Recently, the major commercial foundations, such as Novo Nordic Foundation, which invests heavily in Danish research, have also echoed the need for research to support the green transition.","In 2017 approx. 66.311 billion DKK was spent on research and development in Denmark. The business community conducted research and development worth 42.9 billion DKK, corresponding to approx. 2.0 per cent of GDP, and thus carried out about two-thirds of the total research and development in Denmark in 2017. The public sector thus performed the remaining one-third worth DKK 23.5 billion DKK, corresponding to approx. 1.1 percent of GDP.

According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2019 Denmark is among the countries that spend the most public funding on research and development per inhabitant. The average of public funding for research and development in 2017 for the 28 EU countries was 193.2 euros per year per inhabitant. The figure for Denmark was EUR 454.6 per inhabitant. Among the countries that have reported data to Eurostat for 2017, only Norway allocated more.

Since the new government came to power in June 2019, the main debate has concerned how the public research system can contribute to green research and societal challenges. Recently the government earmarked an additional 1 billion DKK to green research. The funds will be used to develop new knowledge and solutions to the climate and environmental challenges the world faces.","Today, Denmark is one of the strongest research countries in the world. This is the result of large investments in private and public funded research, as well as a continuous effort in creating optimal conditions for knowledge production. However, knowledge production cannot be carried out in isolation. Denmark aims to become a world leader in turning research into innovation. When companies and entrepreneurs transform research and new knowledge into new technologies, products and solutions, it creates value for society as a whole.

Since 2010, Denmark has attained overall high achievement in the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS). The latest scoreboard showed Denmark to be in third place. However, even though Denmark is categorised as an “innovation leader”, it has yet to fully realise the expected potential (outcome) of increased investments in public research, of more autonomous research institutions with stronger leadership, and of a highly sophisticated and well-developed support system for innovation with many institutions that fulfil specific roles.","The policy debate is focused on how to build the most effective bridges between a strong research-based knowledge system and the application of this knowledge by business and society. One focus area is ""Roles and collaboration"" and how to support a knowledge-based innovation system in which multiple stakeholders with different roles work effectively and in close cooperation towards common overall objectives.","A 2019 report from the Danish Council for Research and Innovation (Dfir) has examined the career paths and recruitment in Danish universities. The Council notes the emergence of structural career malfunctions caused by (a) the significant increase in the number of postdocs in Danish universities; (b) a significant delay in career advancement from 2008 to 2017; (c) a rise in the proportion of women with children leaving academia and other gender equality indicators, which underlines that the pool of talented female researchers at Danish universities might be diminishing; (d) the Danish position of Professor “MSO” (professor with special responsibilities) not being used as intended, but reduced to merely a professorship trial; (e) open competition in Danish research not being sufficiently transparent in the recruitment processes for research positions in the universities. On the basis of this analysis and data, Dfir makes the following recommendations:
1.	Make career paths clear for research in the private sector 
2.	The career guidance for younger researchers should to a greater extent be directed at employment in the private sector
3.	Recruit broadly, openly and internationally
4.	Introduce tenure-track programmes 
5.	Phase out the professor MSO position
6.	Funding models should be developed that allow externally funded research to be carried out by permanently employed researchers in the universities to a greater extent
The current debate around human resources for research and innovation focuses on these recommendations.","The Danish Government acknowledges that education and research plays a central role with regards to identifying solutions to major societal challenges. The Danish government has proposed a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by 70% compared to the 1990 level. Accordingly, in the most recent agreement on allocation of funding from the research reserve (fordeling af forskningsreserven), all the initiatives were linked to the Sustainable Development Goals.",
Estonia,"The wider goals of Estonian research and development (R&D) are based on the competitiveness plan Estonia 2020, which was approved in 2011 and sets the goal of increasing productivity per employee to 73% by the year 2015 and to 80% by the year 2020 compared to the European Union average. To and achieve this, the plan proposes to increase the volume of investments in R&D to 3% of GDP (1% in the public sector and 2% in the private sector).

The strategic development of research and development is directed by the R&D strategy, Knowledge Based Estonia 2014–2020, which combines, in addition to the activities of the Ministry of Education and Research, the respective courses of action of other ministries. In addition to the Ministry of Education and Research, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications contributes the most to R&D activities within the framework of the Estonian Entrepreneurship Growth Strategy.

The Estonian R&D governance system needs further development to coordinate R&D policy adequately at the national level. To increase the research-intensiveness of society and the influence of R&D, all national policies should support the development of a knowledge-based society and research-intensive economy, and R&D policy should form a coherent system. In accordance with the Research and Development Organisation Act (TAKS), ministries are responsible for planning, organising and financing research and development that is necessary for their respective areas of government. The Government of the Republic, advised by the Research and Development Council (TAN), should ensure inter-ministerial cooperation in implementing national R&D policy. However, coordination of inter-ministerial cooperation in R&D has been insufficient so far. This is reflected in the fragmentation of R&D funding, which limits the resolution of cross-sectoral policy issues, and impedes the development of best practices. The skills of planning and using R&D are uneven, which undermine the ability of the state to be a demanding and conscious R&D contracting entity. From 2016 the positions of scientific councillors were introduced in the ministries to advice them on research issues and participate in the planning and implementation of the ministry’s R&D, both domestically and internationally. The initiative has led to significant activation of ministerial R&D activities, but further actions are needed to strengthen a common understanding on R&D issues, improve coordination and share best practices. 

General R&D policy capacity and attention is split between the Ministry of Education and Research and Ministry of Economic Affairs. So far, the limited cooperation between the two ministries has left a gap where other countries would have an R&D-related innovation policy. However, as the new joint strategy for R&D, innovation (RDI) and entrepreneurship is developed, the joint initiatives of the two ministries are expected to close the gap. 

The 2019 peer review of the Estonian RDI system commissioned by the European Commission emphasises the lack of ‘directionality’ in the Estonian RDI system. Specifically, a widely-agreed vision on the directions of future development is missing, as is a corresponding set of priorities to build national competitive advantage at the level of research organisations, higher education, ecosystems and clusters. Even as Estonia has defined its Smart Specialisation, it needs further strengthening. In addition, thematic priorities emerging from the international trend towards addressing societal challenges in RDI policy still need to be considered. While Estonia alone can have little influence on the necessary transformations, it can decide where to focus its own work on societal challenges in light of Estonian needs, bringing Estonian comparative advantages to bear in chosen niches.","International evaluations recognise that, in general, Estonian research is internationally competitive and forward-looking. Estonia has a number of successful research groups, many of which are at an outstandingly high level, especially in the fields of natural sciences. International cooperation is extensive and the science infrastructure is at a high standard. 

However, there are critical trends that might affect the countries' future research performance. Despite rapid GDP growth, Estonia has poor total factor productivity, which is likely to become a constraint for further growth, especially as Estonia’s overall R&D spending and business expenditure on R&D have not kept up with GDP growth. Since 2011, the Estonian government has committed itself to spending 1% of GDP on R&D, a target that has yet to be achieved. In December 2018, just a few months before parliamentary elections, the political parties, universities’ representatives, the president of Academy of Sciences, and business sector representatives signed an agreement to reach 1% public spending on RDI by 2022. The rectors committed to excellence in science and increasing cooperation with the business sector. Scientists, represented by the president of the Academy of Sciences and the president of the Young Academy of Sciences promised to work in a balanced manner on basic and applied research, and to prioritise research necessary for the societal and economic development of Estonia. Business sector representatives committed to intensify innovation activities and seek further possibilities to increase university-business cooperation. However, during the budgetary negotiations for 2019 and 2020, the increase in RDI spending was not as high as was hoped on the basis of the agreement, due to the tight budgetary conditions leading to disappointments among the research communities.

Another issue is how to improve access to research results and data In this regard, the principles of open science are currently being developed and aligned with the overall open data policy.","In 2019, Estonia started to prepare its new Research and Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship strategy. To help prepare the new joint strategy, a general assessment of the effectiveness of the research and innovation (R&I) system, and a specific assessment of the role and impact of the R&I system in promoting added-value (Horizon 2020 Policy Support Facility) were carried out.

The main recommendations are to:
-	Ensure political commitment to the importance of R&I in national policy and to meet the 1% target for government spending on R&D.
-	Establish and implement thematic priorities for R&I policy, in the light of societal challenges and Estonia’s smart specialisation strategy.
-	Establish an innovation agency to support R&D and build absorptive capacity.
-	Strengthen the system of ‘intermediary organisations’ to support industrial innovation.
-	Modernise and ‘profile’ research at the universities, making them better adapted to innovation and the production of human capital to meet national needs.

In addition, a Spending Review of Innovation and Entrepreneurship was adopted, together with a comprehensive implementation plan by government in October 2018.","Several policy initiatives support business-university links. For example, the algorithm of basic funding for research institutions rewards contract-based research, giving business sector contracts double weight compared to other contracts. A recent initiative, the proof-of-concept grant for researchers who would like to extend the business potential of their research, has also been launched. Programmes to develop research capacities in fields relevant for the Estonian economy are to be launched in 2019 and 2020, with a specific focus on ICT and natural research valorisation. 

However, as stated by the recent evaluation of Estonia's RDI system, elements of knowledge transfer within the Estonian RDI system are poorly developed. Estonian universities’ knowledge exchange activities appear decentralised and focus on the classic patenting and exploitation functions. There is a need to promote education and consulting of researchers and implementing proactive processes for routine disclosure of inventions and identification of commercial potential. There is also a shortage of funds for the first exploitation steps, i.e. the evaluation of IP, its usefulness to industry and the route to market.

At the same time, Estonia also lacks an open system of ‘innovation intermediaries’ outside academia to support industrial innovation. The need remains to improve innovation services for companies, including intermediation of university-business cooperation. The new RDI strategy currently under development puts strong focus on building the capacity of knowledge transfer and improving business-university linkages, including strengthening the technology transfer offices of the universities, developing innovation services and providing additional funding schemes for technology intensive start-ups.","The number of researchers per 1,000 employees in Estonia lags behind many successful innovation countries. In addition, the costs per researcher are among the lowest in the OECD countries. As the labour market of researchers is international, a topical issue is how to attract talents to Estonian research systems and how not to lose young promising researchers. 
Universities are in process of developing academic career models and evaluation systems for academic staff, which would bring more stability to the career system, while at the same time offering enough flexibility to value, in a balanced manner, all career elements of researchers: research, teaching, consultancy and contractual work outside the university, and self-development. With the new career model, there is a possibility to ensure more stability for researchers by introducing tenure for talented researchers. The new academic career model must also improve the match of researchers with the labour market needs of both the private and public sectors.
Another topical issue is the promotion of inter-sectoral mobility of researchers. In Estonia, the number of researchers outside academia is very low, which affects the performance of the business sector in RDI activities. To strengthen the absorptive capacity of companies, an increase in the number of competent people with a scientific background is needed. At the same time, inter-sectoral mobility would offer researchers new career perspectives and increase the attractiveness of research careers.","Another concern for the public research system is the socio-economic impact of research. There are increasing claims from wider public, especially from business sector that the research is not serving society enough. There are strong pressure to link research with the needs of the economy.",
European Union,"The next EU Framework Programme for research and innovation (Horizon Europe) will cover the period 2021-2027. Its main novelties include: 
-	The creation of the European Innovation Council (EIC), a one-stop shop for innovation to bring the most promising ideas from lab to real-world application and help the most innovative start-ups and companies to scale-up.
-	The definition of six clusters for cross-disciplinary and collaborative research and innovation (as opposed to the Horizon 2020 sector-based approach.
-	The adoption of EU-wide missions with ambitious goals tackling some of the biggest problems affecting our daily lives in five areas, i.e. adaptation to climate change, including societal transformation; (ii) cancer; (iii) healthy oceans, seas and coastal and inland waters; (iv) climate-neutral and smart cities; and, (v) soil health and food. 
-	A new approach to European partnerships streamlining the type and number of public-public and public-private partnerships.

The implementation of Horizon Europe will introduce a new co-creation/co-design governance approach, with the early involvement of Member States, extensive exchanges with the European Parliament and broad consultation with stakeholders and the public at large. This will lead to the publication in 2020 of a Strategic Plan that will set out the key strategic orientations for the first years of implementation of Horizon Europe, effectively bridging policy objectives and support actions. The governance of Horizon Europe will therefore become more cross-disciplinary (e.g. cluster on climate, energy and mobility); more mission-oriented (e.g. mission on cancer) and more impact-driven (e.g. missions, partnerships and strategic planning). At the same time, the governance of Horizon Europe will become more inclusive through extensive exchanges with Member States and the European Parliament, and broader consultation and engagement of stakeholders and citizens.","The most salient policy debate is the balance yet to be struck in supporting two different kinds of research: (i) research based on predetermined top-down priorities (i.e. close to market and applied research) evaluated on the basis of impact; versus, (ii) bottom-up basic research evaluated on the basis of excellence. A related issue is the balance between project-based competitive research funding and institutional or block funding. In this respect, an area of debate is whether evaluation and allocation mechanisms are fair (particularly bibliometrics and peer review).

Over the years, the Scientific Council of the ERC has taken measures on gender balance, open access, widening European participation, strengthening international participation and innovation. It has also looked at ethics review, remuneration, interdisciplinarity and the ERC’s budget allocation between scientific domains.

In terms of recent prominence, Science Europe’s Plan S initiative has contributed to putting the debate of open access in the spotlight.","One of the priorities of the EU research and innovation (R&I) policy debate concerns how to direct industrial R&I agendas towards more investments in sustainability. Part of the overall strategic objective of Horizon Europe (the upcoming EU R&I framework programme), is to successfully address climate change and contribute to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals. A set of policy actions will be taken at the EU level to boost the transition to climate-neutral industries (i.e. zero-pollution and zero-waste), including support to the European Green Deal (a priority for the new Commission) and new European partnerships. The EU strives to ensure that the transition also includes competitiveness. In this context, business innovation will need breakthrough technologies that should be not only purpose-oriented but also profitable. 

European industrial R&I agendas and the issue of environmental sustainability are also linked to strategic value chains and the EU must tackle missing segments in this regard. To this end, EU R&I efforts will pay specific attention to key parts of strategic technology supply chains: ranging from secure and sustainable supply of raw materials (maximising the value of its resources and materials) to batteries, low-carbon industries, space critical components and smart connectivity platforms. 

Furthermore, Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) play a crucial role. They are building blocks of industrial competitiveness in global value chains and, as highlighted by the High-level Strategy Group on Industrial Technologies, they play a strategic role in industry, the economy and society. The updated set of KETs includes advanced materials and nanotechnology, photonics and micro- and nano-electronics, life science technologies, advanced manufacturing and processing, artificial intelligence and digital security and connectivity. The ongoing policy debates also address the conditions for scaling-up innovative and breakthrough solutions in particular by SMEs, where an analysis by the European Commission confirmed the role of Technology Infrastructures and the need for a European strategy.","The EU Council’s conclusions on ""Accelerating knowledge circulation in the EU"", adopted on 29 May 2018 considers that the EU needs to make full use of the relevant scientific and technological knowledge it produces and ensure a more effective transfer of R&I projects results to society and industry. This, in the aims of maximising the impact of R&I investment and further amplifying the added value of the EU Framework Programme. The Council also acknowledged the crucial importance of circulation and transfer of knowledge for an efficient European Research Area. It invited Member States to step up efforts to examine and share best practices on knowledge transfer, e.g. by optimising access for innovators and citizens to national and regional R&I programmes and by fostering science-industry collaboration. It also called on the Commission to encourage the application of the principles and measures of its 2008 Recommendation on the management of intellectual property in knowledge transfer activities and the Code of practice for universities and other public research organisations. 

In 2018, the European Research Area Committee’s (ERAC) Standing Working Group on Open Science and Innovation (SWG OSI) delivered its Recommendations on Open Science and Innovation (ERAC 1216/18). These aim to support national and European policy on open science and open innovation. I also seeks to guide the implementation of priority 5 of the ERA Roadmap: optimal circulation, access to and transfer of scientific knowledge. 

The Commission proposal for Horizon Europe includes a broad range of activities supporting science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing, such as collaborative research, public-private partnerships, mobility programmes, the European Innovation Council and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. Horizon Europe will put emphasis on the exploitation and valorisation of research results and innovation by introducing associated criteria in the rules for participating and implementing the strategy.","The fundamentals of a successful European Research Area (ERA) are excellent researchers. To ensure these, it is necessary to improve the attractiveness of research careers in Europe and the conditions for their mobility. One of the most important tasks on the way towards a genuine European research labour market is transparent, open and merit-based recruitment. This makes research careers more attractive and is linked to mobility, gender equality and research performance. Strong human resource policies have positive impacts on career prospects, especially for young researchers. Member States are invited to remove to cross-border research recruitment, as well as to support initiatives such as “EURAXESS – Researchers in Motion” and the “European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers”.
Member States are joining their efforts to offer researchers adequate framework conditions and to ensure a single European labour market for researchers in the long run. The European Research Area Committee’s (ERAC) Standing Working Group on Human Resources and Mobility (ERAC SWG HRM) is the structure to support the implementation and the monitoring of open labour markets for researchers (ERA Framework for Priority 3). It also deals with areas related to research careers and mobility, i.e. across and within Member Countries and also concerning the international attractiveness of the EU as a whole. Specific initiatives include the European Charter for Researchers, the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers, the Human Resources Strategy for Researchers (HRS4R), the Students and Researchers' Directive EU 2016/801, the EURAXESS services and network, the European Higher Education Area (EHEA).","While the benefits of research and innovation (R&I) for economic growth have been widely documented, R&I is also key to deliver answers to complex social problems (e.g. social mobility, poverty, inequalities), to provide solutions to mitigate effects of climate change and biodiversity loss and to improve overall well-being. At the same time, digitalisation and new technologies are revolutionising the way we live and work. We are at the cusp of a new wave of innovation with unprecedented complexity, concentration of innovation benefits and a steadfast pace of change. The digital transformation led by the US and China is rapidly changing the life of European citizens and putting pressure on the competitiveness of European companies.

The European Union, through its political leadership, took the decision to lead the transition into a more sustainable growth model and accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Commission’s reflection paper « Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030 » identifies research and innovation as enablers to accelerate the transition towards an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable Europe. The Political Guidelines of the new Commission point to the need for Europe to lead the transition to a healthy planet while stimulating innovation, competitiveness and jobs. More specifically, Europe is to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent, as reflected in the priorities of the next European Commission 2019-2024 through its “Green Deal for Europe”, the new action plan for the Circular Economy, a new strategy for a Sustainable Blue Economy, a new “Farm to Fork” strategy and the future Plan for Beating Cancer. 

The European Commission is working on systemic measures that enable R&I to turn sustainability into Europe’s competitive advantage:
-	by setting long-term direction for investments (through Horizon Europe and, most specifically, its missions); 
-	by joining up investments (with the Member States and private actors through joined investment agendas), 
-	by introducing reforms to the national and regional R&I systems (e.g. through the European Semester analysis and recommendations), and
-	through smart and friendly regulation. 

This systemic approach across policies, sectors and disciplines is not possible without strategic planning, co-design and co-creation with citizens and public at large and without a participatory implementation. It would also entail the combination of technological innovation with new business models, innovative finance and regulation, modern governance, skills and social innovation.",
Finland,"The new government programme for 2019-2023 sets several objectives for R&D policies. The key is to put Finland’s RDI investment on a growth track. A roadmap will be drawn up to raise RDI investments to 4 per cent of GDP by 2030 and to make Finland the world’s best environment for innovation and experiments. Steps will be taken to build a stronger model for public-private partnership in innovation. Despite increases in public expenditure in the programme and the first state budget for 2020, the available funding and measures face the risk of being insufficient. Private funding is of greatest significance to meet the 4 % target, a goal which necessitates fluent and effective interaction with the private sector. A strategy for sustainable growth, and a cross-sectoral programme to promote exports and international growth to 2030 are other initiatives to strengthen RDI-activity in Finland. The government programme includes a pledge for knowledge-based policy-making, too, with deeper cooperation with the scientific community.
 
The role of the Research and Innovation Council (RIC) has been identified as important, but in recent years RIC has lost its role in coordinating national R&D efforts, a function that was characteristic of Finland in the past decades. RIC is set to start its work under the new government, but its role and significance remain to be seen. The national coordination of R&D policy remains a challenge, a concern which pertains to sectoral R&D policies as well as the roles of different national funding organizations. 

R&D policy centred around phenomena, as well as missions, is both an opportunity and a challenge. This question revolves partly around the right mix of bottom-up and top-down policy actions. 

The regional dimension of R&D policy includes both tensions and opportunities. On the one hand there has been consolidation and specialization in the HEI field, and many of the country's regions have own strengths and specialization in international business and R&D. On the other hand the HEIs remain numerous, and the eastern part of the country is lagging behind in economic development, processes which cause friction in an urbanizing country of a fairly strong regional policy tradition.

One major effort in research and education components of STI policy will be the forming of Government report on education and research in 2020. Despite its modest title, the government report will be of very important strategic value, including a comprehensive analysis on the state and direction of the research and educational system. There is also debate as to how the voice of higher education institutions and research institutes could be strengthened, and how the role of representative organizations (UNIFI, Arene, Tulanet) could be developed.","The main focus during the past few years in Finland has been the target of 4% GDP spent of R&D funding by 2030, set by the Finnish Research and Innovation Council (RIC) and later confirmed by the Government of Prime Minister Antti Rinne. The ratio was 2.73% in 2017. This is understood to be a very ambitious goal and most ongoing policy debates around R&D and public research system revolve around it. The key in achieving this target is seen to be stimulating private sector R&D activities and how the public research system plays a key role in this. 

Among policy debates currently discussed are the following: the ideal ratio between competitive research funding (channelled mostly through the Academy of Finland) against the basic funding provided directly to higher education institutions by the Ministry of Education and Culture. Higher education institutes have higher degree of freedom to spend the basic funding as they see fit, while bulk of the competitive funding is directed to research activities. Furthermore, there has been some discussion on the right balance between research funding directed to teams of researchers and individual researchers. The former is understood to facilitate co-operation between researchers while the latter may offer more security and stability for research careers. 

Other policy debates have involved the decreased funding to clinical research, the former government's cuts on R&D and innovation spending and the right balance between funding to public research institutes and higher education institutions. Finally, an ongoing debate remains that over whether Finland should pool more resources to develop critical mass in larger research-intensive universities or continue to maintain a network of smaller higher education institutions in most regions of the country.","The Government’s target is to reach an R&D expenditure-to-GDP ratio of 4% by 2030. The majority of contributions should originate from the business enterprise sector. Of all R&D financing, business R&D accounts for about two-thirds while public sector’s share is about one-third. The R&D cuts during the previous government period particularly hit Business Finland, the main innovation funding agency, which has been going through a merger and transformation. Business Finland was created in 2018 by the merger of two organizations: (i) Finpro, which offered services for internationalization, investments and tourism promotion; and, (ii) Tekes, which offered funding and networking for innovation activities.

The government programme for 2019-2023 aims at creating international billion euro ecosystems that provide solutions to global societal challenges. Innovation policy should enable and support the private businesses to play the leading role in this development. This goal requires better and wider cooperation and ecosystems that engage actors from the private sector, the scientific and education community, the third sector and the public sector. Business Finland Growth Engines are an important tool for this goal.

Fast growth, business renewal, new and scalable business models and digitalization remain as important goals and challenges for the private sector. The rapid development of data economy and platform-based companies necessitates new forms of data-intensive business and better data sharing/access solutions. This includes the utilization of available valuable data sources, e.g. from health sector. Both EU and national legislative changes are needed to support valuable market-based and data-intensive solutions.

It has been challenging to reform firm subsidies to better support innovation and renewal. The government has to cut annual subsidies (including tax reliefs) by 100 million EUR. Innovative public procurement is an important tool to improve services, generate growth and enable the creation of reference markets. The goal is to raise innovative public procurement as a share of total procurement to 10% by the end of the parliamentary term in 2023, from its current level of about 5%.

The pressures to change EU competition policy may affect the Finnish landscape where firms try to scale their businesses through innovation. A big challenge is to enable start-ups and other fast-growing firms to grow in Finland, as opposed to being bought out or relocating their functions elsewhere. The same dynamic applies for firms' R&D functions, where Finland faces toughening competition from other Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) environments. A general question is how much firms should be supported, how support should be allocated between firms of different sizes and which policy tools are most effective in encouraging private investments in RDI.","The focus of science-industry knowledge transfer has moved to strengthening public-private partnerships and ecosystems rather than aiming to support technology transfer or commercialisation of research-based inventions. Based on the new 2019-2023 government programme, the aim is to build internationally attractive centres of excellence and ecosystems. Measures are also taken to strengthen regional specialisation, the role of cities as development platforms of innovations and the building of internationally networked innovation clusters. Nokia still accounts for a significant bulk of private R&D expenses in Finland, but its smaller role has had an impact not only on conducted R&D per se, but also in the formation of cooperation and ecosystems. Now there is a need for co-creation instruments and collaborative open platforms. While universities of applied sciences have a wide regional spread and closely cooperate with businesses, their role in innovation system should be further developed.

Other issues on the policy agenda are developing new instruments for the early-stage financing of research-oriented enterprises and a better utilisation of private equity funding. 

There is also an identified need to increase the mobility of experts between research and business (PhDs, post-docs and others), as current incentives and cultural values do not support this sufficiently. The practices of open science have advanced, but their significance for industry actors remain uncertain. New skills and resources for knowledge transfer and intellectual property rights in the science-industry interface need to be developed, including the usage, sharing and openness of data.","Human resources (HR) are one of the critical components for Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) performance, alongside national RDI expenditure. During the past few years, one of the central debates on HR in RDI has centred on young PhDs in universities. While the university sector needs new researcher talent to replace retired staff, universities cannot absorb all graduated PhDs. Far too few are employed in the private sector and especially in RDI activities. This has raised questions about the right volume of PhD production and various means of embedding other professional skills in researcher education. Furthermore, it has been argued that academic appointments should consider private sector RDI experience to facilitate mobility between the research community and the private sector. 
The target of 4% GDP in R&D expenditures has been seen to necessitate a number of developments in the HR component. First of all, added attention has been paid to the equality and diversity issues in the field of research and especially in innovation, where white-male dominated RDI teams are the norm. Second, a clear need emerged to better identify and value the skills and education of the immigrant population in Finland, to make the most out of their potential. Third, continuous or lifelong learning has received intensive attention from the private sector and the public education system. It is seen as one of the main tools to increase and maintain the high quality skills and education that Finland is currently enjoying.
Especially in the past years, there has been a concern for how long it takes students to graduate. Currently, a more central question is what kind of skills set they should have and how their professional ambitions could be met.","Addressing societal challenges is a rising theme with big expectations in STI policy. The new government has set the major objective of providing solutions to global development challenges. Public-private partnerships are essential to provide effective solutions to global challenges based on national strengths. From a business perspective, the goal is the creation of international billion euro ecosystems to provide such solutions. There are Finnish businesses that have successfully built turnover based on long-term R&D investments and the sustainability of products. In the future, stronger data economy solutions are needed. From the government’s perspective, a whole-of-government approach is needed whereby funding and governance jointly support tackling global societal challenges. The new strategy for sustainable growth will be an important platform for bringing sectoral priorities (including circular economy, health and low-carbon actions) together under one umbrella. Furthermore, sector-specific low-carbon roadmaps, in line with new climate actions, will be prepared in cooperation with industry operators.

One of the government's objectives is to increase partnerships with African countries. Finland will prepare a comprehensive Africa strategy based on the 2030 Agenda. The incorporation of Social Development Goals into STI policy has been studied and analysed, but systematic instruments are still missing. 

Finland also faces challenges lying outside the spheres of environmental sustainability and international development, such as an ageing population, low birth rate, the reform of social and health services and a structural deficit. The strengths of the innovation system have not been sufficiently leveraged to tackle these challenges.",
France,"a)	Regulation supporting experimental institutional forms:
In order to ease amalgamation or even merging of existing institutions for both teaching and research activities, new institutional forms seemed to be necessary. The regulation of December 12, 2018 allows universities and public research organisations to experiment with creating new joint institutional forms at the local level to address their missions. New structures gain significant weight to define particular strategy of the site, with new own identity, and to articulate their specific project of the site with government priorities. .

As of 2019 a renewed process of contractual dialogue between the State and the universities and bodies under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation was established in order to enhance the mobilisation of public research actors. This renewed contractual dialogue aims to strengthen the major research universities on the basis of co-constructed objectives between institutions and national research organizations with a goal to intensify their local strategic coordination. Public research organisations are now fully involved in this strategic and programmatic coordination at the territorial level.

b)	Multi-year research programming bill: 
In a context of global competition, the French Government wants to place its support to research into a multi-year programming law. In early 2019, the Prime Minister asked the Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, to explore the establishment of a new law for orienting and the multi-year programming of research. While the bill is still in the process of being defined, it is expected to encompass budgetary measures and simplification measures and, according to arbitration, a strategy to be articulated at national and subnational levels.

This exploration has been carried out by three working groups:
-	Group 1: Project research, competitive funding and laboratory financing, 
-	Group 2: Attractiveness of jobs and scientific careers, 
-	Group 3: Innovation and partnership research.

On the basis of proposals made by these working groups, the Minister will propose to the Prime Minister the major axes that will structure this multi-year programming law. The schedule foresees a draft by the end of 2019, and adoption by the parliament in the course of 2020. The new law will come into force in early 2021, and will replace the current French National Research Strategy (SNR 2015-2020), enshrined in the 2013 law on higher education and research.
http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid138611/vers-une-loi-de-programmation-pluriannuelle-de-la-recherche.html","The French Government is in the process of preparing a multi-year research programming bill that would replace the current National Research Strategy (SNR 2015-2020). This will be presented to parliament in 2020 with a view to enactment in 2021.

The National Open Science Plan announced by the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation in July 2018 makes open access for publications and project-based research data mandatory. It sets up an Open Science Committee and supports major structuring initiatives related to publications and data. It also has a training component and an international component that are essential for the mobilisation of scientific communities and the influence of France in this area.
http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid132529/le-plan-national-pour-la-science-ouverte-les-resultats-de-la-recherche-scientifique-ouverts-a-tous-sans-entrave-sans-delai-sans-paiement.html.","In the context of preparing a multi-year programming law of research (that should be drafted by the end of 2019, for adoption in the year 2020 and come into force in early 2021), a working group was set up to make proposals to strengthen innovation and collaborative research in France. These proposals, which were submitted to the Government in September 2019, are structured around three main fields of priority actions:
i) 	Develop new leaders based on discoveries from public research and that will create tomorrow’s markets;
ii) Significantly increase the breadth, depth and continuity of public-private, public-public and public-civil society interactions;
iii) In the short term, gain significantly in simplicity, agility and speed and empower the innovation actors.

Alongside this bill, the Government also launched a public consultation to prepare a 2025 Productive Pact for full employment, which includes a thematic section on technological innovations. On this topic, the ongoing work focuses on the need to foster “deep tech” innovation, to densify the industrialisation of innovation in France, and to improve the legibility of innovation public support.
Independently of this bill, the Government has also reaffirmed its intention to maintain the research tax credit in its current configuration. However, and despite positive evaluations of this instrument, there are still ongoing debates about the rate of the research tax credit, as well as on the right balance between direct and indirect policy support to business R&D and innovation activities.","As part of preparations for the new multi-year programming law of research, a working group was set up to make proposals to strengthen innovation and collaborative research in France. On strengthening private-public research and innovation linkages, the working group pointed out:
-	the complexity and lack of clarity of public policy that supports collaborative research and innovation;
-	the insufficient structure of local innovation ecosystems;
-	the existence of barriers, or at the very least, the lack of incentives for PhD holders and public researchers to engage in collaborative research and innovation activities.

To cope with these issues, measures have already been taken within the action plan for business growth and transformation (PACTE law promulgated in May 2019). The legislative and regulatory framework reinforces the principle of the ""single agent"" (mandataire unique), which allows companies to have a single point of contact when they wish to exploit innovative results from public research. This will facilitate pathways between labs and companies creating new services or products, and thus accelerate innovation.","As part of preparations for the new multi-year programming law of research, a working group was set up to make proposals how to strenghten the attractiveness of scientific jobs and careers in France. This working group pointed out the following issues: 
-	Revalorise the indemnity levels of all public research personnel.
-	Revive permanent scientific employment by stabilizing the number of statutory jobs.
-	Revalorize PhDs.
-	Improve the career development of academics.
-	Modernize human resource management by facilitating mobility and strengthening evaluation.

It takes into account social, environmental and economic issues that our societies have to face through rapid transformations. Additionally, new technologies that are already transforming the world bring both, opportunities and risks to reach the SDGs. Given the complexity of the 17 SDGs and their interactions, or even the tensions between them (employment vs. climate, consumption vs. health, etc.), new knowledge, qualified by the scientific approach, is essential to ensure the necessary transitions. Such ""science in the service of the SDGs"" requires enhanced interaction, and as much as possible a joint construction between citizens, scientists and decision-makers. 
Within the recent French Roadmap to achieve SDGs, three complementary axes are proposed for STI to be implemented through a national action plan:
-	Evaluating and assessing the issues of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
-	Enlightening the opportunities and risks of different development scenarios
-	Experimenting by testing and sharing know-how.

Germany,"With the High-Tech Strategy 2025, mission orientation of national STI policy is becoming more prominent, involving a broad range of stakeholders, accompanied by a rising need in governance of STI policy and a more focused directionality in innovation funding. Strategic orientation has changed from a “key technology“ to a “grand challenges” and now to a ”mission-based“ approach. This is accompanied by a widening notion of innovation including social innovation, new business models, process innovation and participation of society.

A main objective of the High Tech Strategy 2025 is to strengthen the technological basis in close connection with a skilled workforce in Germany. Recent decisions in this area concern the adoption of the Federal Government's artificial intelligence strategy, and education policy initiatives such as the ""Digital Pact for Schools"" or the new skilled labour force strategy. Related to this issue is also the updating of the Pact for Research and Innovation in 2019, and the decision for funding future “Universities of Excellence”, which was also taken in 2019. 

In addition, a need is seen in Germany to make STI policy more agile, risk taking and disruptive. With the creation of the new agency for disruptive innovations (SprinD) in 2018, this discussion has led to a completely new funding approach. More innovation oriented framework conditions is another focus of the discussion. 

Among other measures, an R&D tax scheme will be introduced in 2020. It will be designed so that it specifically targets SMEs and supports cooperation between businesses and public research institutions. The R&D tax scheme will complement, not replace, the project-oriented R&D support system already in place. The scheme will be a substantial contribution to achieving the national target of spending an annual 3.5% of GDP on R&D.","Science policy in the German public research system is largely implemented by joint programmes (""pacts"") of the federal government together with the Länder governments. These programmes are based on five principles: enabling excellent science, providing reliable and ample funding perspectives, respecting autonomy and responsibility of higher education and research institutions, establishing new (infra)structures for new challenges, and strengthening the links between science and society.

In 2018 and 2019 major agreements between the federal government and the Länder were achieved: on the continuation of federal funding for teaching tasks of the universities with a strong focus on quality of education; on the continuation of the “Pakt für Forschung und Innovation” concerning increases in basic funding for the large non-university research organisations and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft”; on initiatives to strengthen “Fachhochschulen” for applied sciences; and on a common mechanism to fund research data infrastructure and high-capacity computing. 

The Excellence Strategy (Exzellenzstrategie) is a funding programme of the Federal Government and the Länder to strengthen cutting-edge research at universities in two funding lines: Clusters of Excellence and Universities of Excellence. The “Clusters of Excellence” funding line provides project-based funding in internationally competitive fields of research at individual universities or university alliances. The “Universities of Excellence” funding line sets out to strengthen universities or university alliances as institutions and to expand their leading international position in research on the basis of successful Clusters of Excellence. The Excellence Strategy was adopted in 2016 to succeed the Excellence Initiative.

The transfer of ideas, knowledge and technologies from research to practice is a societal and economic necessity. Innovation processes have changed and accelerated in recent years. The Federal Ministry of Research and Education aims to strengthen transfer and to implement it as ‘the third mission’ of universities besides research and education. This aim is supported by specific agreements in pacts and targeted support measures. Additionally, in 2020, an R&D tax support scheme will be introduced. It will further support cooperation between businesses and research institutions.","Germany has a broad range of support programmes for innovative enterprises, rather than a single activity to support business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship. An important approach of the German Federal Government is to motivate and enable especially SMEs and young enterprises/start-ups to innovate through networks and clusters and therefore to strengthen their market position. Pilot programmes like, e.g. KMU-NetC, offer additional funding for innovative, industrial demanded R&D projects with high prospects of realisation but that have high scientific and economic risks.

The actual national innovation strategy (High Tech Strategy 2025) is also focusing on collaboration between research and industry. The strategy aims to further strengthen the transfer of knowledge and research results into new products and services. A further key element of the strategy is to build up an entrepreneurial culture in Germany and to improve framework conditions for startups.","With the 2018 High-Tech Strategy 2025, the transfer of knowledge has been addressed even more prominently. One of the 12 missions of the High-Tech Strategy 2025 is about new sources for new knowledge, focusing on opportunities offered by open access, open science, open data and open innovation.

Central goals are to increase the proportion of open access publications in the scientific community and, with increased funding, significantly increase the number of new, more open forms of cooperation between companies, civil society stakeholders and scientific institutions. Regarding the funding initiative “Zukunftscluster-Initiative” (“Clusters4Future”) the transfer from basic research activities into application is being supported, based on cooperation between academia, industry and further intermediaries.","The High-Tech Strategy 2025 clearly states that new research areas and new technologies require new skills and abilities. The support for emerging research fields will go hand-in-hand with the support for highly qualified minds in their respective fields. 
The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) launched together with the social partners and the Federal Employment Agency in coordination with the Länder in June 2019 the National VET Adult Strategy (Nationale Weiterbildungsstrategie). The strategy builds on the initial vocational education pathways and aims to facilitate career advancement and upskilling for broad sections of the population, to strengthen skilled labour development, and to foster long-term employability in times of digital changes.
The Skills Strategy will bring together , among others, the various skills development programmes of the Federal Government and the Länder. These programmes will be geared towards the needs of the workforce and businesses, particularly SMEs. The overarching goal is to develop a new culture of lifelong learning.
The Strategy Paper sets out ten objectives agreed by the partners of the VET Adult Strategy who will formulate commitments, either individually or jointly, regarding specific activities and projects in order to implement these objectives. 
Moreover, BMBF has initiated a large number of new measures to contribute to the dynamic developments in the area of digitalisation and automation, pooling them under the umbrella of “Vocational Education and Training 4.0”. These include keeping job descriptions up to date continuously and demand-oriented; investing in training facilities; promoting the use of digital media in initial and continuing vocational training; supporting SMEs in the transformation process to economy 4.0; and supporting the qualification of trainers in companies and training facilities, as well as teachers at vocational schools and examiners.","As a central goal of the third framework programme for Research for Sustainable Development, FONA3 (duration 2015-2019), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research actively fosters and facilitates a strong dialogue between research and society. The programme develops foundational decision-making tools for future-oriented action and delivers innovative solutions to create a sustainable society. The FONA Framework Programme implements both the Federal Government’s new High-tech Strategy and the 2016 National Sustainability Strategy. The process of developing FONA 4 has already begun and is guided by the UN 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. 

In recognition of the essential role scientific research plays in sustainability, the Federal Government launched the Science Platform Sustainability 2030 in mid-2017, which is being implemented by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The Science Platform 2030 is a nexus for sustainability research. Among other objectives, it identifies pressing sustainability policy issues in consultation with stakeholders from politics, business, and civil society, particularly regarding the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.",
Greece,"The General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT) is the central authority in Greece responsible for the design and management of RTDI policy. A central issue of debate over the last decade has been whether GSRT should belong to the Ministry of Development or to the Ministry of Education. In particular, in 1982 an independent Ministry for Research and Technology was established, which was subsequently downgraded in 1985 to a General Secretariat (GSRT), under the auspices of different configurations of the actual Ministry of Development up until 2009. Thereafter, GSRT was transferred to the Ministry of Education. After the general elections in July 2019, GSRT returned to the Ministry of Development and Investments according to Presidential Decree 81/2019.

The main arguments are as follows:
-	First Option: GSRT-Ministry of Education. Universities are core elements of the RTDI system in Greece, since they conduct the most important part of R&D activities (as sector of performance). There is a need to link research to education and create a National Research and Education Area. In many European countries, the R&D portfolio belongs to the ministries of education.
-	Second Option: GSRT-Ministry of Development. RTDI is an important driver for growth. The main deficiencies of the Greek research and innovation system are the weak linkages between industry and academia, as well as the poor contribution of the private sector to R&D activities. There is an urgent need to reinforce oriented research in order to respond to the needs of the economy and society rather than support blue sky or curiosity driven research, where Greek universities and research centers perform relatively well, taking into account indicators such as publications, citations or participation to the European Framework Programmes. 

In either case, GSRT has built interlinks with the research communities in both Ministries, since:
a)	at the policy design level, GSRT formulates the R&D policy of the country through a bottom-up procedure that involves stakeholders of the quadruple-helix, including Higher Education Institutes (HEIs)
b)	at the policy implementation level, HEIs under the Minsitry of Education are included in the target beneficiaries of the calls announced by GSRT.","Despite the rigid fiscal consolidation and austerity measures during the previous years, R&D intensity increased as a percentage of GDP as well as in absolute numbers. GERD reached 1.13% in 2017 whereas the initial target set for 2020 was 1.2% of GDP. These recent positive developments in R&D intensity led to an upwards revision of the target to 1.3% of GDP in 2020. This target is included in the National Reform Programme 2019, led by the European Union.  

Policies to enhance the public research system include:
-	Initiatives to enable technology transfer and strengthening the links between universities, public research institutions and the business sector (collaborative projects, intermediary organisations and mechanisms)
-	Flagship initiatives enhancing research activities and networking among public research organisations to address critical aspects of the Greek economy and society (in particular in the agro-food sector for olive oil, wine and honey production; personalized medicine for cancer, genetic cardio-vascular and neurodegenerative diseases; and climate change)
-	Enhance the visibility, competitiveness and active participation of Greek teams in the international research landscape (in Horizon 2020, initiatives under art.185 of the Treaty, in other international organisations).
-	Initiatives to reverse brain drain/ brain waste.

Furthermore, an evaluation of performance of the public research centers and institutes operating under the auspices of GSRT is also foreseen to begin before the end of 2019. The evaluation will be carried out according to international standards.

As far as research integrity is concerned, a new law entered into force in 2018 providing for the establishment of a Committee for Ethics and Integrity in Research in each university and public research centre. The Committee, composed of 5-7 specialized scientists, is mandated to examine the research projects carried out in the Institution on a moral and ethical basis. The decisions of the Committee are binding for the Institution.","Despite a rapid improvement in innovation performance, as depicted by the European Innovation Scoreboard 2019, Greece remains in the group of ""moderate innovators"" and shows a low score in competitiveness according to international benchmarks. Limited venture capital (VC) and PCT patenting activity, as well as poor linkages between enterprises and the research community have been identified as major obstacles for innovation in the country. So the continuous debate is centered on the commercialisation of research results and the promotion of knowledge-based, innovative entrepreneurship. Following the general election of July 2019, the new Government announced the establishment of two ""Innovation Districts"", one in Athens and one in Thessaloniki. These are public-private partnerships, aiming at attractive dynamic companies with important R&D activities, which, in cooperation with public research institutions and innovative start-ups, will promote open innovation in the country. Furthermore, innovation and digital hubs are also under consideration.

To boost innovative entrepreneurship, a new VC Fund of Funds, the so-called ""Equifund"", was recently established. Equifund has been operational since 2018. It aims to attract private funding to all investment stages of the equity market from entrepreneurship steps (even before the early stage start-ups) up to the mature expansion of the beneficiary companies. Nine fund managers were successfully selected during 2017. EquiFund comprises three investment “windows” according to the maturity level of the business proposal:
1.	The ""Innovation Window"", aiming at supporting investments in RTDI through commercialisation of research results. End target beneficiaries include researchers, professors, postgraduates and graduate students, as well as entrepreneurs willing to pursue their business opportunity.
2.	The ""Early Stage Venture Capital Window"", which encompasses later stages of seed and start-up, targets SMEs or entrepreneurial activities with high growth potential and in need of funding for product development, initial marketing and/or business development support, including the assessment of the commercialisation potential of an initial concept.
3.	The ""Growth Window"" provides for later early stage, expansion / growth capital and buy-and-build.  

The aggregate size of all funds has currently exceeded EUR 410M.

Following an intense debate, the government decided that traditional schemes providing grants for the establishment of spin offs, spin outs and innovative star-ups would not be launched in the programming period 2014-20, to avoid competition with the Innovation Window of Equifund. However, other initiatives continue to operate, including: 
-	The flagship Programme “Research-Create-Innovate”: funding industrial research in all types of companies, industry-academia collaborative projects, experimental development for R&D results, supporting Greek SMEs that received a ""Seal of Excellence"" from the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument, and job creation for highly skilled personnel in businesses.
-	Specific Actions for Collaborative research projects between businesses and academia in priority areas (Aquaculture, New Industrial Materials and Cultural Heritage)
-	Support for Innovation Clusters in priority areas.","The weak linkages between enterprises and the research community have been identified as a major obstacle for innovation in the country. To tackle this failure, a continuous debate is centered on the establishment of long-term, strategic cooperation between industry and academia, as well as setting up appropriate intermediary organisations and mechanisms for the commercialisation of research results. A programme supporting Innovative Clusters was launched in September 2019. Furthermore, programmes for Technology Transfer Organisations (TTOs) in Higher Education Institutions and Research Centers, as well as for the establishment of Competence Centers are also under preparation. Debates on how to maximize the efficacy of such initiatives are at stake, together with state aid issues. 

In the context of the National Smart Specialization Strategy 2014-20, a participatory process for “entrepreneurial discovery” was followed through a combination of open and targeted consultation with the whole RDI ecosystem (academia, research and businesses). Consultation resulted in defining the thematic priorities of the two successive calls of the ""Research - Create - Innovate"" flagship programme, whose main component consists of industry-academia collaborative projects. However, despite a huge demand for the programme, there are concerns on whether or not it leads to long lasting cooperation rather than to partnerships of an opportunistic nature. Specific programmes for R&D collaborative projects were also launched following an intensive entrepreneurial discovery process in fields of major interest to the Greek economy: Aquaculture, New Industrial Materials and Cultural Heritage.","A dramatic outflow of highly skilled personnel affected Greece during the recent economic crisis. In 2009-2015, a ten-fold increase of brain drain compared to 2000-2005 was recorded. Brain drain and brain waste are considered the main threat to the Greek research and innovation ecosystem, thus efforts are focused on actions and initiatives to reverse them. For this purpose, an independent organisation was founded, the Hellenic Foundation for Research & Innovation (HFRI). Its main mission is to support curiosity driven research and highly skilled research personnel with funds secured from the Greek Government and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the framework of an agreement that has been transposed into National Law (L.4429/2016). Most HFRI funds are devoted to doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships and grants, open to all scientific disciplines without thematic or geographical constraints, selected solely on the basis of scientific excellence.

Furthermore, apart from HFRI, all RDI GSRT funding schemes strongly encourage the creation of jobs for highly skilled personnel in research organisations and businesses by providing funding for new scientific personnel. In addition, the ""Knowledge-Bridges"" programme is a recently established interactive platform aimed at mapping and monitoring the profiles of highly skilled Greek professionals living abroad, as well as supporting networking and exchange of know-how with the Greek diaspora. The main debate in that respect centres on the potential benefits from the international mobility of specialised human resources and brain circulation.

Recently, under a new national initiative entitled ""Re-brain Greece"", launched by the Ministry of Labor, possible actions to reverse brain drain by attracting, among others, PhD holders in Greek firms are also discussed.","The General Secretariat of the Government, after taking up the task of coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at national level, has undertaken initiatives, through the setting up of an Inter-ministerial Coordination Network and the social partners. The major stakeholders, including the Economic and Social Council of Greece (ESC), which is the constitutionally recognized institution responsible for the conduct of social dialogue, and in which the social partners and all other major stakeholders are represented, contributed their input as to the specific thematic SDGs Greece will have to focus on. 

Research, technological development and innovation (RTDI) lie at the core of the process of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially for SDGs 8.2, 8.3 and 9.5. Specifically, the development of innovative rural waste management technologies, the reuse of waste water, the development of more mature clean water production technologies for agricultural use, the development of urban and industrial effluent treatment systems, the development of innovative, cheap and energy-efficient soil and groundwater decontamination technologies with a pilot application in degraded areas, to integrate water management within protected areas management system, and the restoration – redevelopment of degraded and deserted Mediterranean regions, the mitigation and adaptation to climate change and natural disasters, such as mitigation actions on the carbon footprint of a business (carbon footprint), desalination on the islands and actions to protect areas from sea level elevation, protection of biodiversity, reduction of the CO2 footprint of energy intensive industries either with CO2 capture systems or by process intensification and measures to avoid carbon leakage are all priorities within the National STI policy which are related to SDGs.

Additionally, flagship initiatives have been launched to address major societal problems. Flagship Initiatives are horizontal research actions in emerging areas of research with a strong social dimension and innovation dynamics such as the National Network of Precision Medicine in Oncology, Cardiovascular Diseases and Genetic Neurodegenerative Diseases (for more effective and low-cost therapies for precision medicine accessible to citizens by the Public Health System), the National Agri-Food Network (to highlight the qualities of traditional products such as Olive oil, Wine, Honey) and the National Climate Change Network (for studying and validating information on extreme natural phenomena).",
Hungary,"The “Investment into the Future - National Research and Development and Innovation Strategy 2013-2020” (RDI strategy) was approved by the Hungarian Government in June 2013. Currently a new RDI strategy is being developed with the long-term aim to become a strong innovator country by 2030. The Ministry for Innovation and Technology (ITM) and the National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) has launched a review of the National RDI Strategy, and in the beginning of 2019 launched a new consultation mechanism, the National Innovation Forum and at the end of 2019 NKFIH launched Territorial Innovation Platform (TIP) as an other new consultation mechanism.

The European Innovation Scoreboard, compiled by the European Commission, shows that Hungary is not performing well. Hungary, like other Visegràd Group countries (including also Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia), is still regarded as one of the so-called ""moderate innovators"". Problems of the current research, development and innovation (RDI) system of Hungary include:
-	Lack of capabilities to generate the social and economic benefit that is essential to increase Hungary's competitiveness.
-	Under financing of the public research system and its institutional fragmentation into a number of universities, different research institutes belonging to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and sectoral institutions supervised by various ministries.

Given these challenges, the transformation of the institutional and financing structure of the research institute network has become a government priority with a view to creating an RDI system that is competitive in both capacities and infrastructure at a European level.

Along these lines, for the first time in Hungary’s history, the government established a separate Ministry for Innovation and Technology in 2018 to improve the performance of RDI ecosystem of Hungary to become a strong innovator by 2030. The fields that fall under the scope of competence of the Ministry are economy development, energy and climate policy, info-communications, transport and sustainability, vocational training, adult education and higher education. Due to the Government restructure in May 2018 the Ministry was established to take over the responsibility for the integrated management of domestic science policy. The creation of the Ministry can be seen as an indication of the Hungarian government’s commitment to RDI. The government’s aim is for Hungary to perform cutting-edge research, development and innovation at European level. To this end, the government’s target is to raise the amount of total R&D expenditures in Hungary to 1.8% of GDP by 2020.","The Hungarian RDI system is undergoing major reforms led by the Ministry for Innovation and Technology. There are two strategic bases of the intended reforms: 
-	A mid-term peer review of the implementation of the 2013-2020 Strategy conducted by international experts in 2016.
-	A 10-point resolution of the Hungarian Government on the need to reform the RDI system, in October 2018.

The main elements of the reform include:
-	The establishment of the National Science Policy Council (as scientific advisory body of the Hungarian government).
-	The establishment of a unified National Research, Development and Innovation Fund.
-	An increase of the annual RDI public funding level by 25%.
-	The establishment of publicly funded research networks dealing with basic and applied research (Loránd Eötvös Research Network (LERN) and Bay Zoltán Applied Research Network, respectively). The LERN currently comprises of the 15 research institutes that were previously under the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS). Bay Zoltán Applied Research Network is an integrated publicly funded network dealing with applied research based on the funding and operational model of the German Fraunhofer network.

The government’s intention with the establishment of the LERN is to create a better and more independent organisation with the following key elements: 
-	The research network is not linked to the executive branch of the government but to the Parliament. Therefore it has the same independent status as the HAS.
-	Its budget is included in an independent chapter in Hungary’s central budget. It does not belong to the HAS, nor to the Ministry of Innovation and Technology (MIT). In the 2020 central budget, a higher amount appears on the LERN chapter than in 2019. 
-	The LERN’s Governing Body will have 13 members of which 6 members are nominated by the HAS and another 6 members are nominated by the MIT. The chairman of the Governing Body will be appointed based on the mutual recommendation of the HAS president and the MIT minister. The Prime Minister appoints the members and the chairman for a term of 5 years. According to the regulation, at least two-thirds of members must be selected from the scientific field, in order to guarantee the scientific aspects of decisions. 
-	The work of the Governing Body will be supported by a Scientific Council and an International Advisory Board formed exclusively of foreign scientists, guaranteeing a wide professional quality, in line with the research excellence principle and international transparency of the activities of the new network. These bodies do not exist in this form in the present structure of the HAS. 
-	Real estate and other property used exclusively for research purposes will remain in the ownership of the HAS. However, the HAS will provide it free of charge to the research network for carrying out research tasks.","The main policy challenges consist of increasing the share of innovative businesses and building innovative capacities. This is realised by expanding co-operation both horizontally and vertically. Horizontally refers to university-based innovation ecosystems as a translational function between science and innovation. Vertically refers to the innovation value chain built around companies. Government grants and training programs help companies in technological and organisational innovation. Legislation helps companies to an easier path to become government suppliers. Thus, it is necessary to develop and strengthen complex, process-based, multi-player support systems, with a focus on scientific, economic and social embedding.

The government is also committed to provide ongoing support for Intellectual Property generation and commercialization, both nationally and internationally, through various means, including RDI grant financing, state-backed VC funds, and training and incubation programs for technology intensive companies to access foreign markets.","The Hungarian Government has established the Science, Innovation, Technology and Industrial Park Network in order to achieve fully integrated cooperation between industry, research and academia. Future Science Parks will also include incubators, accelerators, venture capital funds and business angels. On the bases of the most recent policy debate on the move to a 3rd generation university model (i.e. the new role of universities in the frame of the knowledge triangle applied to the park network),the universities' main role in knowledge transfer is of high importance. This means the most important instrument in knowledge transfer and sharing is the programme to strengthen the innovation ecosystem at universities.

In addition, the government is promoting market-oriented knowledge transfer projects with new calls for proposals for open innovation (focusing on vertical innovation capacity building), university ecosystem building (focusing on horizontal innovation capacity building), and the Competence Centres – Research Infrastructures development programme. Government policy also supports the use of soft instruments to promote knowledge transfer, e.g. participation in different mobility programmes, such as the Fulbright programme. The dissemination is encouraged by networking programmes organised by the National Research, Development and Innovation (NRDI) Office, e.g. the Regional Innovation Platform (TIP) programme.","The main challenge is that the country does not have enough qualified young researchers – both at the master’s and doctoral levels – to meet the needs of the academic and industrial RDI sectors. The current RDI strategy (A chance of pace in higher education) sets the target of 56 000 researchers by 2020. Initiatives like the structural reform of doctoral education and the introduction of “dual education” for first degree programs (based on collaboration between universities and industrial partners) are expected to improve the situation. Across the country, several multinational corporations have established long-term relationships with higher education institutions. The introduction of dual training is an important step to provide students with formal opportunities to gain contemporaneously practice-based know-how, work experience and academic knowledge. However, a few years will be necessary before their effects can be evaluated.

The introduction of dual training is an important step to provide students with formal opportunities to gain contemporaneously practice-based know-how, work experience and academic knowledge. However, a few years will be necessary before their effects can be evaluated.","The government considers that both in Hungary and in Europe additional support should be given to RDI projects rather than focusing on restrictive regulations that could hamper the competitiveness of successful European industries (e.g., promoting green tech solutions for the automotive industry rather than climate quotas). Hungary is highly interested in e-mobility. Adopting a dedicated e-mobility plan (known as Jedlik Ányos) indicates the government’s commitment to support RDI activities related to e-mobility and to enhance the production of e-vehicles. The government aims to increase the number of patent applications to the European Patent Office to achieve progress towards the EU average in the field of e-mobility. 

Hungary – as an EU Member State – regards the Horizon Europe EU RDI framework programme and its financial resources as extremely important in enhancing RDI activities, and in promoting cooperation across the EU. One of the government’s main goals is to realise European convergence through the R&D excellence, in particularly within the Horizon Europe RDI framework programme, which will largely contribute to the competitiveness and growth of the EU. Pillar 2 of Horizon Europe is dedicated to solving global challenges (such as climate change) and will promote European industrial competitiveness through its dedicated clusters (e.g.: climate, energy, mobility and food, bioeconomy). The Hungarian government regards Horizon Europe missions to have strategic importance in strengthening European competitiveness, since missions are expected to have a maximised impact within a set timeframe and wide social relevance addressing global challenges that are of great significance for European citizens. Hungary has recently amended its Act on RDI in order to restructure the institutional and financing system of the Hungarian RDI System. In the new structure, the government has put special focus on the priorities of the Horizon Europe programme, especially its second pillar related to global challenges. Hungary’s main priority is a higher rate of success in its applications of support from Horizon Europe.",
Iceland,"The Science and Technology Policy Council is responsible for setting public policy in matters of science and technology in Iceland. The role of the Science and Technology Policy Council is to support scientific research, science education and technological development in Iceland so as to strengthen the foundations of Icelandic culture and increase the competitiveness of the economy. The Science and Technology Policy Council operates pursuant to Act No 2/2003. The Council is chaired by the Prime Minister and its members include the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, the Minister of Education, Science and Culture, the Minister of Tourism, Industry and Innovation, as well as 16 representatives nominated by different ministries and higher education institutions and by the social partners. In addition, the chair may appoint up to four other ministers to the Council. 

The Council sets the official science and technology policy for a three-year period. The Council's deliberations in each of the two fields are prepared by its working committees, the Science Board and the Technology Board. The Science and Technology Policy Council is convened 2-3 times a year. The Council is currently working on a new Policy and Action Plan, the previous having run its course in 2019.
Current debate focuses on revising and modernizing the founding legislation from 2003 and with it the structure of the Science and Technology Policy Council, to simplify the structure and clarify the role of individual actors in the system. There is an ongoing revision of the legislative framework for the Council, which includes revision of such structural issues and is due to be completed by the end of 2019.

An innovation policy for Iceland until 2030, An innovative Iceland, was launched in late 2019 by the Minister of Tourism, Industry and Innovation. The policy will be followed up by actions for improvement and development of innovation support and ecosystem.","The main focus of debate is the level of funding that is available for public research, including open competitive funds, and the way in which this could be increased and prioritised within the framework of future societial challenges that Iceland might face.   

In late 2018, resulting, amongst other approaches, from a wide public consultation, the government identified the main societal challenges for the period 2018-2021: Environment and sustainability, Health and welfare, and Life and jobs in the world of change. These should be emphasised in strategically placed funds or initiatives for research using public funds.

There had also previously been an emphasis on Icelandic language technology, to promote Icelandic as a language in a digital world with an emphasis on strategic funding for ""future proofing"" Icelandic in light of digitalisation. 

In its policy from 2017-2019, the Science and Technology Policy Council emphasised the need for increased and more transparent funding for Higher Education Institutions, driven by a greater set of variables than the current model which is mostly based on student numbers. Subsequently a national Green paper on funding for Higher Education has been produced and is out for public consultation in late 2019. A working group will work further with the material to develop a new funding model for Higher Education Institutions in Iceland during 2020. Overall funding for higher education has increased from 81% of the OECD average in 2015 to 94% of the OECD average in 2016.

In addition, the Science and Technology Policy Council identified policy development on Open Access, covering both data and publications, as one of its 10 priorities in its National Science Policy and Action Plan for the years 2017-2019. A working group on ”Policy on Open Science“ was established. The working group will submit proposals to the Minister of Education, Science and Culture by end of 2019.

More effective investment in research infrastructures, including international infrastructures was one of the actions in the National Science Policy and Action Plan in 2017-2019. As a consequence, Iceland published a report mapping current research infrastructures in March 2019. New legislation allowing the establishment of and participation in European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERIC) was agreed in parliament in the first half of 2019. A report on a Research Infrastructure Roadmap was finalised in 2019 and it is anticipated that the Board of the Infrastructure Fund will release a Roadmap for RI investment for Iceland in 2020. Legislative changes have been made to establish separate Boards for the Infrastrucure Fund and the Research Fund.","A new innovation policy for Iceland, An Innovative Iceland, was published in late 2019, and is intended to make Iceland better able to meet the challenges of the future by building a solid foundation for innovation in all areas, including the public sector. Innovation is presented not only as the basis of economic success, but as the key to solving the biggest challenges in the coming decades. The delivery of the plan is the responsibility of the Science and Technology Policy Council, devolved to relevant ministries and institutions. 

The three broad challenges that the new innovation report address are the 4th Industrial Revolution, Environmental Challenges, and Demographic Challenges. 

The strategy focuses on five pillars (see below) and under those are 70 initiatives in total to realise the following vision: “Iceland is an innovation country where willingness to innovate is built into Icelandic society, culture and business. Innovation is seen as a prerequisite for a thriving culture and human life and essential to be able to meet societal challenges as well as to ensure continued welfare and value creation in the country.”

The five pillars are: 
I.	Mind set: An attitude that is prevalent in the community towards innovation, research, development and start-up activities. The spirit of innovation in society has an impact on its ability to innovate. Innovation is to be lifted as fundamental to culture and society, well-being and value creation, through outreach, education, and increased visibility. 
II.	Finance: Funds spent on research, development, innovation and start-up activities. The amount, source, and distribution of funds in the innovation environment has a significant impact on its scope and nature.
III.	Market access: The larger the market that Icelandic entrepreneurs and investors have access to for goods and services and financing, the more diverse innovation activities are likely to be able to thrive in Iceland.
IV.	The Regulatory framework: in the form of support agencies, legal frameworks, infrastructure and co-operation. The support environment for innovation, along with general rules of innovation and business operations, must always be competitive with the best in the world.
V.	Human resources available to Icelandic innovation companies. Iceland must develop and invite people who have the knowledge and skills needed to face international competition and Icelandic companies need to be able to attract specialized foreign staff to the country. 

The policy will be followed up by actions for improving and developing innovation support measures and the innovation ecosystem.","Iceland recently set up a technology transfer office, Auðna. (TTO Iceland). TTO Iceland is the national Technology and Knowledge Transfer Office for all universities and foremost public research organisations in Iceland. As a non-profit organisation, its mission is to support the scientific community in Iceland with advice on intellectual property protection, analyse market- and patent landscapes, connect inventions and innovative research projects with investors and industry, and enable science & technology to have more impact on society through commercialisation, both nationally and internationally.","There is no specific ongoing debate on government support for human resources for research and innovation. However, there is a lot of debate on skills and skills forecasting in general in Iceland. Statistics Iceland, the Directorate of Labor, the Confederation of Icelandic Employers and the People's Union of Iceland have developed a methodology for skills analysis. This is being used to analyse supply, demand and changes in jobs and sectors, to improve decision-making on education needs and developments, and to meet new challenges or foreseeable problems in the labour market and in the education system. Their methodology was debated in the Science and Technology Policy Council in late 2018 and will inform the strategy for the Council in 2019-2021.
In early 2019 a group working under the Prime Minister’s Office delivered their report on Iceland and the 4th Industrial Revolution, which specifically targets in one of its sections the need for education and skills – in particular the emphasis on the need for more people with skills in creative and critical thinking and STEAM subjects.","In 2018 the Science-and Technology Council launched a wide consultation on Iceland´s societal challenges for the next 10 years and 50 years. Subsequently the government identified the main societal challenges as Environment and sustainability, Health and welfare, and Life and jobs in the world of change. These should be emphasized in strategically placed funds or initiatives for research using public funds.

Green by Iceland is a new government-enterprise partnership forum launched in late 2019. Its role is to strengthen business and government cooperation in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promote carbon neutrality by 2040. The forum will also work with Icelandic companies to promote green solutions in the international market and support Iceland's reputation as a leading country in the field of sustainability.",
Ireland,"A streamlined governance structure underpins the cross-departmental, whole-of-Government approach to how Ireland’s research strategy is developed and implemented. Innovation 2020 (I2020) is Ireland’s strategy for research and development, science and technology.

Innovation 2020 outlines the Government’s approach to enhancing Ireland’s research, development and innovation base. It sets out a range of actions focused on increasing enterprise engagement in RDI, improving the quantity and quality of skilled workers, effective regulation of intellectual property, promoting collaboration with EU and international RDI activity and streamlining governance. Innovation 2020 is available at https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/Innovation-2020.html.

Responsibility for oversight of Innovation 2020 rests with an Implementation Group, chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI), which reports annually to the Government on progress under Innovation 2020. The Progress Reports, with updates on metrics and indicators, are available at https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/Innovation-2020-Progress-Reports.html.

A Mid-term Review of Innovation 2020 was noted by Cabinet in June 2019 and is available at https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/Mid-term-Review-of-Innovation-2020.html. The Review acknowledges the changes in the policy environment and reaffirms the continued relevance of I2020 in ensuring the delivery of excellent research and driving innovation in Ireland. 

Future Jobs Ireland is our new whole-of-Government framework for the next phase of Ireland’s economic development. It outlines our longer-term ambitions for the future of the economy, under five key pillars. Future Jobs Ireland will build on progress made to date by focusing on securing the quantity and quality of skilled workers required in light of increased automation and digitalisation, improving the capacity of enterprise to absorb technology and exploit its advantages and opportunities; and encourage greater RDI activity to keep Irish enterprise at the frontier of innovation.
Innovation 2020 will conclude at the end of 2020 and work has commenced on the development of its successor.","In late 2015, Government agreed to the publication of Innovation 2020, Ireland’s cross Government strategy for research and development, science and technology, and to the adoption of its vision of Ireland becoming a “Global Innovation Leader” as a whole of Government policy goal. I2020 sets out the roadmap to deliver on this vision with a focus on maintaining and improving standards in the excellence of research, developing the talent to facilitate research and innovation and ensuring there is tangible and positive impact upon the needs of our society and economy.

Direct public spending on RDI increased considerably in the 2000s, from €607 million in 2004 to a record €930m in 2008. Investment fell as a result of the economic crash to a low of €719 million in 2014 but recovered to an estimated €766m in 2018. While the Irish economy has recovered and strengthened in the past number of years, levels of public investment have not returned to the peak of 2008. This can be attributed to the limited fiscal space which has impacted on budget allocations across Government departments and also to the fact that the very high levels of public investment in the years to 2008 were unsustainable. Public spending is principally undertaken by DBEI and the Departments of Education and Skills, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Health, and Communications, Climate Action & Environment. Ireland’s low levels of public investment in RDI place us 24th in the EU28 for public RDI expenditure according to the recent European Innovation Scoreboard.

Across Government, there is a compelling need to ensure that the importance of funding for RDI is kept to the fore. Significant increases in public investment will be required to make progress in delivering on the key objectives in Innovation 2020 and to leverage increases in Business Expenditure on R&D (BERD) through, inter alia, requirements for industry to match State funding in collaborative programmes, and improving programmes targeted at increasing BERD.

As has been recognised in Future Jobs Ireland, investment in innovation is an essential component in developing the economic and social infrastructure necessary to ensure a resilient and competitive enterprise base and in addressing many societal challenges. In addition to Future Jobs Ireland, innovation is a common thread running through many government policies, including, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the National Development Plan 2018-2027 (NDP).

The first Pillar of Future Jobs Ireland, “Embracing Innovation and Technological Change”, will build on progress made to date by focusing on securing the quantity and quality of skilled workers required in light of increased automation and digitisation, improving the capacity of enterprise to absorb technology and exploit its advantages and opportunities; and encourage greater RDI activity to keep Irish enterprise at the frontier of innovation. Achieving the Innovation 2020 vision of becoming a Global Innovation Leader is recognised in Future Jobs Ireland as being key to fully embedding resilience and ensuring long term sustainable growth.
The higher education element of Ireland's public research system is guided in the main by two central strategies: Innovation 2020 and the National Strategy for Higher Education. Out of the latter flows the Higher Education System Performance Framework 2018-2020, on the basis of which bilateral performance compact agreements have been reached by the HEA with each higher education institution. A ‘compact’ sets out how that institution’s ambitions and plans intend to contribute to delivery of each of the six 2018-2020 Framework system-level objectives (one of which pertains to research and innovation).

Some of the main current debates in Ireland around research and innovation policy include how one builds on economic impact and toward greater societal impact of research. This is consistent with international developments. The role of research and innovation in sustainable regional development is also a live issue and will be teased out in the formulation of Future Jobs Ireland 2020. And the balance of research investment is another live discussion: the balance between investment in investigator-led research vs. centre-led research; between and across disciplines; across the basic-applied/TRL spectrum; and between national support and international success.","Ireland’s third Country Specific Recommendation for 2019 highlights the need for measures to diversify the economy and improve the productivity of Irish firms, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular, by using more direct funding instruments to stimulate research and innovation and by reducing regulatory barriers to entrepreneurship.

Future Jobs Ireland notes that significant vulnerabilities are evident in the domestic economy such as declining productivity levels in SMEs. Infrastructural constraints, skills deficits and labour availability, as well as concentrations in some sectors and markets could, unless ameliorated, impede further progress. Internationally, Brexit, growing trade protectionism and the undermining of the rules-based international trading system could threaten our future economic welfare. (https://dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Business-Sectoral-Initiatives/Future-Jobs/) 

The OECD has undertaken a review of entrepreneurship and SME growth and development in Ireland in 2018. The OECD SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland report examines how to strengthen SMEs and entrepreneurship across the economy (https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/OECD-SME-and-Entrepreneurship-Policy-in-Ireland.html). 

The National Space Strategy for Enterprise (https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/National-Space-Strategy-for-Enterprise-2019-2025.html) will also support the success of other national strategies. Placing a focus on embracing innovation, technological change and enhancing skills, the strategy will support Ireland to achieve the ambitions of Future Jobs Ireland.","The updated national IP Protocol was published in 2019. More recently, Knowledge Transfer Ireland has published its Guidelines to State Aid considerations in Research, Development and Innovation.
Knowledge Transfer Ireland helps business to benefit from access to Irish expertise and technology by making it simple to connect and engage with the research base in Ireland (https://www.knowledgetransferireland.com/). 

Innovation 2020 supports the creation of an intellectual property regime that encourages the creation of proprietary knowledge and its diffusion. It commits to strengthening knowledge transfer for innovation, promoting more extensive commercialisation of public research, seeking to improve IP exploitation by Irish enterprise and positioning Ireland’s IP framework to encourage innovation. Ireland’s targets for commercialisation of public research are on course and two are already exceeded.

Ireland’s two main enterprise development agencies are Enterprise Ireland (EI) and IDA Ireland. EI is the State agency responsible for supporting the start-up and growth of world-class Irish companies targeting global markets. EI operates a range of programmes to foster entrepreneurship and drive innovation (https://enterprise-ireland.com/en/Research-Innovation/). IDA Ireland is Ireland's inward investment promotion agency. IDA Ireland promotes interaction between overseas and Irish companies in research collaboration, business development and skills, provides funding support for RDI projects and identifies support opportunities from partner organisations. (https://www.idaireland.com/doing-business-here/activities/research-development-and-innovation).

Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) funds research in STEM areas that promotes and assists the development and competitiveness of industry, enterprise and employment in Ireland (https://www.sfi.ie/funding/industry-collaboration/). Through focused investment in excellent and impactful scientific research and talented researchers, SFI ensures that Ireland leads the world in strategic research areas, has globally recognised SFI Research Centres, and is a hub for industry/academic research collaborations. 

The Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, or DTIF, invests in the development and deployment of disruptive innovative technologies and applications, on a commercial basis, targeted at tackling national and global challenges (https://dbei.gov.ie/DTIF).","Government support for R&I human resources centres on the development of a sustainable pipeline of researchers: at all career stages and whether they continue their careers in academia or in enterprise.
Increasing enrolment of postgraduate researchers to address demand in the economy is a key goal of Innovation 2020. While progress has been slow initially, a number of initiatives commenced in 2019 that will have a positive impact on enrolment numbers. One example is the SFI Centres for Research Training programme. SFI has awarded funding of more than €100 million to six new SFI Centres for Research Training, which will provide training for 700 postgraduate students in areas of nationally and internationally identified future skills needs of digital, data and ICT (https://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/centres-for-res-training/). Additionally, the Irish Research Council awarded 215 postgraduate researchers under the Government of Ireland programme in 2019.

As well as the numbers of researchers, their skills on evolving issues are key, such as Open Research and Research Integrity. Such issues are being progressed in Ireland through dedicated fora such as the National Open Research Forum and the National Research Integrity Forum.
Mobility is a vital element of a researcher’s development. As well as international mobility between research institutions, intersectoral mobility between industry and academia forges important linkages between research and innovation performers. The HEA Graduate Outcomes Survey provides an essential source of information on graduate transitions into the labour market and further study in Ireland. SFI tracks the first destinations and long-term career outcomes of researchers. This is considered a key performance measure for the agency and is critical to strategic decision-making. As of May 2019, the percentage of SFI alumni whose eventual destination was industry is 50%. DBEI supports the EURAXESS Ireland Office, which is hosted by the Irish Universities Association and facilitates researcher mobility. In 2018 EURAXESS Ireland processed 566 hosting agreements and 168 agreements were extended. The hosting agreements covered researchers from 77 different non-EEA countries.","In recent years, there have been many developments that have a bearing on the future focus of research, including Ireland’s adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which seek to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda; and Ireland’s adoption and ratification of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. 

The National Mitigation Plan 2017 (https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/climate-action/topics/national-mitigation-plan/Pages/default.aspx) recognises that RDI will play a key role in Ireland’s transition to a low carbon economy and society by 2050. The UN SDG National Implementation Plan (https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/topics/sustainable-development/sustainable-development-goals/Pages/National-Implementation-Plan-2018---2020.aspx) is in direct response to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and provides a whole-of-government approach to implement the 17 SDGs. The National Policy Statement on the Bioeconomy (https://www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/20180312-Bioeconomy%20-%20National%20Policy%20Statement.pdf) recognises that the bioeconomy is crucial for sustainability and circularity while also providing an impetus to rural and regional development and employment.

The Climate Action Plan 2019 (https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/climate-action/publications/Pages/Climate-Action-Plan.aspx) sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 emissions targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the EU’s overall commitment under the Paris Agreement and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
Ireland has strategically programmed and built a strong climate research and innovation infrastructure, with funding provided to Ireland’s research producing organisations to carry out science and policy-relevant research, as well as establishing dedicated Enterprise Ireland Technology Centres and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) research centres.

Three National Research Coordination Groups (https://www.epa.ie/researchandeducation/research/nationalcoordination/) in the fields of climate research, sustainability and water have been set up to coordinate environment research in Ireland.

The updated national Research Priority Areas 2018 to 2023 report (https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/Publication-files/Research-Priority-Areas-2018-to-2023.pdf) reflects the increased urgency of the need to address climate change, with a new research priority theme focusing on Energy, Climate Action and Sustainability, and two priority areas concentrating on decarbonising and sustainable living and also smart and sustainable food production and processing. The refreshed areas also focus on improved health and well-being outcomes, the need for climate smart, environmentally sustainable and resource efficient food systems.",
Israel,"Apart from specific debates about ongoing activities, there is no public debate regarding how national STI policy is governed.","The main policy debate regarding support for public research relates to the components of the research funding model for Israel's research universities, including how the model can be optimized in order to promote excellence in research.","Government support for business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship in Israel was traditionally comprised mostly of R&D direct incentives, namely grants. This policy was very successful in increasing the national expenditure on civil R&D in recent decades. Additional policy tools such as the Yozma venture capital funds (where the government was a co-investor) and the technological incubators helped boost the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem. 

Today, the Israeli tech ecosystem is thriving and is enjoying a record amount of private investment in R&D and in venture capital. This raises the question whether government direct incentives for business R&D are still as relevant as they used to be. The government has created other support tools in the meantime - especially for investing in human capital (described in this survey), but legacy R&D support tools are still in place. Many acctors in the government and industry hold the opintion that government support for R&D is still critical to keep Israel's global competitive position, while other emphasize the importance of greater government focus on regulation and ease of doing business for the tech industry as a first best policy.","In Israel, science-industry knowledge transfer is carried out mainly through Tech Transfer Offices (at least in patentable research fields such as life sciences. In software there are more available channels). The applicative research institute model is much less common. Recently, many have expreseed doubts regarding the extent TTOs engage with the local industry, especially in young technological ecosystems in Israel, where it's easier for them to work with established foreign corporations compared to local startups. Therefore, the government has been working on re-designing incentives for TTOs in order to increase their engagement with the local industry and increase their outputs in general.

A second and parallel issue is applicative or translational research in emerming technologies such as biotechnology, nanotechnology etc. This also affects the pipeline of innovation assets the TTOs are able to offer the industry, of course. It seems the incentives for university researchers to engage in applicative research that may benefit the industry are sub-optimal. This is an important debate especially in biotech for healthcare, as the Israeli academia has been producing world-leading research outputs, that are rarely translted to industrial innovation in Israel.The Bioconvergence strategic plan described in this survey deals will deal also with this issue.","The shortage of technology professionals in Israel represents a challenge to the high-tech sector and to the Israeli economy as a whole. The high-tech sector is the main potential driver of growth in the Israeli economy, and a central asset in it has always been digital R&D talent. However, future growth will be challenged if the country’s supply of digital R&D talent does not grow. 

High-tech companies are struggling to find technology professionals at the moment – this affects mostly Israeli companies (startups & growth), as multinationals are able to offer higher salaries and recruit the best talent. According to a recent survey, there are around 15,000 technological positions in the Israeli high-tech industry – about 5% of total employment and 10% of technological positions in that sector. This shortage reflects, on the one hand, the rapid growth of the Israeli tech ecosystem, especially in ICT, which creates ever-growing demand for human capital. On the other hand, it reflects an insufficient supply of university graduates over the last decade.

Key questions are:

-	How to increase the supply of quality graduates entering the workforce (from academia or other training frameworks), and how to best prepare them for actual R&D work?

-	How to create training schemes that suit the dynamic nature of the high-tech industry? New professions are created faster than the ability to train for them. One example is data scientists. The rapid growth in the field of AI in the high-tech sector, as well as accelerated digitisation in other fields such as the health industry, are creating an increasing need for skilled professionals. The worldwide demand for data scientists grew by 650% in 2012-2017. 

The Israeli government is coordinating efforts to expand the supply of personnel skilled in all high-tech fields by increasing the number of students pursuing high-tech related disciplines in universities, by establishing a variety of extra-academic paths into the industry, by opening channels to recruit skilled personnel from overseas, and by encouraging the study of math and science in schools. Within these efforts, emphasis is being placed on integrating women and underrepresented populations in high-tech sectors (Arabs and Ultra-Orthodox Jews in particular), with a recognition of the unfulfilled potential in these groups.

The results can already be seen on the ground. On the academic front, the number of ICT students comprised 26% of the student body pursuing bachelor’s degrees in 2018, demonstrating a significant spike in this field. In the extra-academic sector, there has been an increase in elite training for high-tech professions due to, among other reasons, the Israel Innovation Authority launching an incentive programme for coding bootcamps. The Authority will also soon launch an on-the-job support tool for R&D. Furthermore, with the objective of increasing resources by attracting overseas talent, the government has created a Green Track for foreign high-tech professionals.","On a national level, an inter-ministerial project for promoting “SDG tech”, with an emphasis on developing countries as target markets, is currently in process. In addition, the Ministry for Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are preparing to adopt the SDGs and to report to the UN on their progression.

The Israel Innovation Authority operates a dedicated division for societal challenges. Since 2017, the Societal Challenges Division focuses on harnessing technological innovation to solve substantial problems in society and the public sector in Israel and worldwide, as well as on developing solutions for the lack of skilled workers in the high-tech industry by increasing the number and variety of employees in this sector. In 2018, the division assembled all of the incentive programmes in these fields under one strategic umbrella of “tech for impact” (the Digital Innovation for Public Challenges programme, Assistive Technologies programme, and Grand Challenges Israel). The programmes were updated accordingly, adding specific impact measurement criteria related to the SDGs. Comprehensive marketing activities were also carried out, together with an array of partners from across the ecosystem, to expand the target audience, increase the scope and quality of the initiatives requesting backing, and focus entrepreneurs in the field on the significant challenges outlined in calls for proposals.",
Italy,"Italian STI policy governance cannot be set apart from what is discussed and negotiated in the European Union and at other international fora. For example, environmental issues, in terms of climate changes, biodiversity, and sustainable agriculture, are important points of discussion, as is sea pollution. Technological innovation, digitalisation and the Next Production Revolution (NPR or Industry 4.0) are also priority topics.

The Ministry of Education, University and Research produced the National Research Plan (NRP) for the period 2014-2020 that elaborated 12 action areas and defined five thematic priorities, as follows:
1.	Aerospace and Defense;
2.	Health, nutrition, quality of life;
3.	Intelligent and sustainable industry, energy and the environment
4.	Tourism, cultural heritage and creativity industry;
5.	Digital Agenda, Smart Communities, infrastructures and intelligent mobility systems.

STI policy is co-discussed with other ministries, such as the Ministries of Health, of Environment, and of Economic Development, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation coordinates international strategy. The Council of Ministries supervises activities at the EU and international levels.","The policy debate is oriented to discuss three main issues at different levels: the national, with the goal of increasing enterprises’ collaborative activity in the field of research and innovation; the European to co-create the next European framework programme for research and innovation; and international to foster Italy's internationalisation of research in terms of researchers mobility, and shared projects and infrastructures. 
Debates are focused at national level with the National Operational Program (PON) Research and Innovation 2021-2027. As for the 2014-2020, the PON is the instrument through which Italy contributes to the improvement of the quality of higher education and to the strengthening of research, technological development and innovation, realizing the objectives of the European Union's cohesion policy in favor of its territorial areas more disadvantaged.

At the international level, ongoing debates resulted in recent years in some relevant outputs, such as the PRIMA and the BLUEMED-EU initiatives, focused on promotion of collaborative research within the Mediterranean countries, including non-EU, in which the Italian commitment in terms of budget and political engagement has been relevant. Other activities such as the debate on the future European framework program of research and innovation Horizon Europe or the dialogue within the “5+5 Science Dialogue initiative” that was presided by Italy in 2018. The Central European Initiative that was presided by Italy in 2019 gave the opportunity for Italy to approach a debate about the role for cooperative research not only within the EU area but also including neighbouring non-EU countries.

Other national debates include the internationalisation of Italian research and higher education (coordinated by the Ministry of foreign affairs) and international cooperation, space exploration and the space economy (coordinated at an inter-ministerial level). All of these issues are discussed at the ministerial level and supervised by the Council of Ministries.","The Italian Government has adopted a set of relevant measures aimed at fostering the creation and growth of its innovative startup (Decree-Law no. 179 of 18 October 2012) and innovative SMEs’ ecosystem (Decree-Law no. 3 of 24 January 2015). An extensive portfolio of incentives was laid out to support innovative startups and SMEs at all stages of their life cycle, from incorporation to expansion and maturity. The need for policies tailored to innovative firms is justified by several public goals. The various measures aim to spur sustainable growth and enhance productivity. An innovation-driven entrepreneurial culture should be spread across the entrepreneurial ecosystem as a whole, including SMEs, large corporations, incubators and accelerators, as well as universities. 

The National Plan Industry 4.0 was adopted in 2016 with the purpose of encouraging and sustaining the digitalisation process of firms through the introduction of fiscal incentives (such as hyper and super depreciation) supporting the purchase of machinery 4.0 and reinforcing – through a tax credit – the level of digital skills. New measures, which are under approval in the Budget Law 2020, will give continuity to these recently introduced fiscal incentives, with the novelty of a wider time horizon. Following the approach of the 2019 Budget Law, the measures will continue to favour particularly micro and small firms. Special attention will be given to innovation in value chains with relation to new technologies and digitalisation.","Debate on science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing is active at national level, at bilateral and trilateral levels, and within international working groups in Italy.

The Ministry of Economic Development has defined the “Impresa 4.0” National Plan (formerly Industry 4.0) to support companies, with the conditions that policy initiatives operate within a logic of technological neutrality; intervene with horizontal and not vertical or sectoral actions; and also act on enabling factors. All the effective measures have been strengthened and addressed according to this 4.0 logic, and new ones have been envisaged to fully respond to the emerging needs related to the NPR. See https://www.mise.gov.it/images/stories/documenti/impresa_40_risultati_2017_azioni%202018_rev_eng.pdf 
In an effort to increase the dialogue between industry and science and technology, Italy has created the Technology Clusters, and the Industrial PhD programmes.

Since 2017, France, Germany and Italy have initiated trilateral cooperation to promote the digitisation of the manufacturing sector and to support the European Union's efforts in this area. The cooperation brings together the implementing bodies of the national strategies for Industry 4.0 in the three countries: Plattform Industrie 4.0 for Germany, Alliance Industrie du Futur for France, and the Piano Impresa 4.0 for Italy, which signed a joint roadmap in Turin in June 2017.

Within the G7 science initiative, Italy has, since 2018, co-chaired with Canada a Working Group on “Financing Science For Inclusive Growth”. The group aims to share expertise, exchange best practices and develop synergies on effective financial instruments and knowledge-transfer policies among the G7 economies, with a specific focus on their ability to improve and underline the crucial value of science and research for the prosperity of society.","Italy needs excellent, enthusiastic and well-rewarded human resources for research. This concept has been stated on different occasions by the Ministry of Education, University and Research, and endorsed by the “Comitato Interministeriale per gli Affari Europei” (CIAE: Interministerial Committee for European Affairs). 
The debate results in policy initiatives aimed at favoring brain attractiveness in Italy and their implementation,   such as: 
?	The Framework for Attraction and Reinforcement of Italian Science Excellence;   
?	The Extraordinary recruitment plan for researchers; 
?	The Doctoral training schemes; and the National Code of Equal Opportunities.   
?	The Legislative decree of simplification of research institutes, aiming to simplify the activities of public research bodies and to better define the researcher professional figure
?	The National Code of equal opportunities is to promote equal opportunities between women and men in all areas of society.","As an integral part of our country’s foreign policy, the Italian development cooperation’s approach is based on two priorities: first, the need to ensure the protection of life and human dignity to all the planet’s inhabitants; and second, a vision of cooperation as a method by which to install, improve and strengthen relations among various countries and various communities. This peer-to-peer exchange, in addition to increasing the mutual understanding necessary for comprehending the real needs of the recipients of interventions, fosters relations aimed at economic and, most importantly, at social and human growth that is respectful of environment and cultural variety and capable of protecting common assets such as water, food and energy, so as to ensure the greater prosperity of populations and peace among people.
Major attention has been given to neighborhood policy, within the Mediterranean area and towards the non-EU Eastern Europe, as scenarios where the diplomacy of science is considered to be functional to national priorities and valuable to help constructing a long-term regional cohesion. 

This approach complementary to the international dialogue dedicated to global challenges (SDGs) and to specific ones that occur within countries geographically far from Italy yet similar in societal issues. The ageing population that is determining a societal switch in many industrialized countries including Italy and Japan is an example. 

Within Italy, the debate aimed in raising public awareness of the value of R&I and the impact on society should materialize in divulging initiatives aimed in opening a continuous two-way communication channel between the citizenry and the R&I community.",
Japan,"To achieve sustainable development in Japan, which faces limited resources and a declining birthrate and aging population, horizontal and comprehensive STI cooperation among the public sector, private sector and other stakeholders is necessary.

To date, Japan has formulated a strategy every year in line with the Fifth Science and Technology Basic Plan (FY 2016-2020) and has defined priorities for further promotion of the Basic Plan. In 2018, the government formulated an “Integrated innovation strategy” with the aim of establishing the “Most Innovation-friendly Country in the world” by integrating the measures of the Cabinet Office and each Ministry. In 2019, the government revised the “Integrated Innovation Strategy 2019” based on the remarkable progress and changes in science, technology and innovation (STI) both at home and abroad. This policy is an important measure in that the government aims to promote innovation policies, from basic research to social implementation, across ministries and agencies.

As a “control tower” of these cross-ministerial policies, the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), established within the Cabinet Office, is composed of experts from academia and industry and chaired by the Prime Minister. CSTI is responsible for planning, guiding, and coordinating comprehensive science and technology policies in Japan.

Furthermore, based on the integrated innovation strategy, the government established the “Integrated Innovation Strategy Promotion Council” in 2018. This Council was composed of the CSTI and the “control towers” of other fields (e.g. information and communications, intellectual property, health and medical care, space, and ocean), in order to further strengthen cross-sectoral coordination across multiple policy areas closely related to innovation.","As for the present state of research capabilities, as measured by the number and quality of academic publications, the government recognises Japan’s relative decline compared to other countries. Basic research capabilities are the source of scientific and technological innovation, and the strength of basic research capabilities has a significant impact on international competitiveness. It is necessary to drastically strengthen Japan’s research capabilities with a view to the future, through the triple reform of human resources, research funding, and the research environment. At the same time, the government recognizes that Japan alone has limited resources, such as human resources and funding for research. Japan needs to strengthen research capabilities while actively cooperating with the rest of the world.

Basic research capabilities are potentially high and are expected to contribute to the creation of seeds that will lead to disruptive innovation. To promote this, it is important for the public and private sectors to cooperate to find promising seeds and to foster young researchers who will tackle them. This cooperation should go beyond conventional university-industry collaboration. While private investment in universities and national research institutes in Japan is on the rise, it has not yet reached a full-fledged level. Further efforts are needed to expand the scope of such investment.

In light of the declining birthrate and ageing population, Japan is facing a serious labor shortage, forcing it to rely on foreign workers in some fields. In the future, it will be necessary not only to improve productivity by making full use of AI and robots and drastically activating start-ups, but also to strengthen the quality of “human resources”, which is Japan’s greatest asset, to meet the needs of the times. The government considers it an urgent task to build a system in which all people participate in society based on the concept of a human-centered society.","The number of R&D-driven startups is increasing and expanding globally. In Japan as well, it is necessary to develop an environment in which the potential of human resources with an entrepreneurial spirit can be maximized, and to promote economic and social structural reform in an integrated manner through innovation in government projects and systems, including public procurement.

To achieve this, it is necessary to thoroughly strengthen the start-up environment by involving cities, universities, and other institutions, in educating world-class entrepreneurs and in drastically strengthening the accelerator function. For example, policies focusing on young start-ups are being promoted to strengthen the start-up ecosystems centred on universities and to promote entrepreneurial education. In addition, while promoting open innovation with large companies, the government will discover promising start-ups in rural areas and those that aim to capture overseas markets from the very beginning (Born Global). There is also need to review government procurement practices to encourage the development and introduction of advanced technologies and investment in the private sector.","The policy challenge is to strengthen industry-academia collaboration where the top management and headquarters of firms are actively involved. Recently, large-scale joint research, led by the top management of companies, and joint research courses in which research teams at companies set up laboratories in universities, have been conducted. It is necessary to continue to strengthen these efforts. In addition, since the National Research and Development Agency has a large number of one-of-a-kind research facilities, it is necessary to enhance the function of these facilities as a hub for innovation among industry, academia, and the government while sharing them with external organizations.","It is important to establish a system in which young researchers can play an active role in a variety of fields, including academia and companies, and that research is an attractive occupation. It is necessary to clarify the path for acquiring tenure posts in academia, with a non-tenure outcome the result of a fair performance evaluation after going through a certain competitive environment early on in careers.
In addition, in the context of falling numbers of doctoral students, the government is pursuing the following three objectives:
-	To make doctoral programmes more attractive by enhancing economic support. 
-	To develop doctoral human resources with advanced specialised knowledge, scientific thinking and methods, and problem-solving abilities in graduate school education. 
-	To create an environment in which young, well-trained researchers can lead challenging and creative research as early and independent principal investigators.
Furthermore, it is necessary for society as a whole to create an environment in which young researchers can foresee a stable career path in the future. Doctoral researchers should be able to play an active role in a diverse range of fields, and a diverse environment should emerge in which female researchers can play an active role.","Science, technology and innovation (STI) are key to solving global problems such as environmental, energy and infectious diseases. Based on this recognition, the promotion of STI for the SDGs will be positioned in the immediate action plan of STI policy and will be tackled by the entire government. The government recognises several challenges to this approach: for example, striking an effective combination of creating innovative technology seeds while promoting the upstream R&D that underpins their emergence; facilitating the creation of new ideas with a variety of experts coming from across different sectors; and fostering human resources who can connect various sectors. To facilitate multi-stakeholder engagement and international partnership for promoting STI for the SDGs, “Guiding Principles for the Development of STI for SDGs Roadmaps” were endorsed at the G20 Osaka Summit.",
Kazakhstan,"Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is regulated by the main laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan in this field: (i) the law ""On Science""; and, (ii) the Law ""On the commercialization of the results of scientific and technical activities. The Entrepreneurial Code provides additional legislative framing. An essential priority for the Kazakh government is to increase its R&D expenditures and stimulate business investment to R&D through different mechanisms. According to a recently approved State Programme for Education and Science Development 2020-2025, the Government aims to raise Gross Expenditures in R&D (GERD) to 1% of GDP by 2025. 

The main goal is to develop effective mechanisms to involve business, industry and private sector in the STI field through joint investments and the joint creation of new products. The government also aims to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of science, by synchronizing it with the business innovation.

The main ongoing issues around the governance of STI policy in Kazakhstan are:
-	increasing the level of funding for STI activities;
-	increasing staff employed in R&D in HEIs and PRIs;
-	improving research infrastructure and digitalization of STI processes;
-	developing effective operation of competitive research funding systems;
-	assessing the impact of public research on innovation;
-	fostering university-industry collaboration;
-	enhancing international co-operation in STI; and
-	increasing the number of publications in peer-reviewed journals.

The State Programme for Education and Science Development 2020-2025 includes most of these activities and targets to achieve them by 2025. For example, in 2018 there were 17 454 researchers in Kazakhstan. By the end of 2025, the Government aims to increase their number to 18 400. Another target example is to increase the number of publications in peer-reviewed journals by 88% and the number of patents by 22% by 2025. The State Programme also aims to improve research infrastructure and digitalise STI processes, enhance international co-operation in STI. 

The governance of STI is coordinated between the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES), the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry (MDDIAI) and other public authorities within the Higher Scientific and Technical Commission. However, this coordination needs more accurate differentiation of responsibilities for each public body. MoES is responsible for science and commercialisation whereas, since 2019, the MDDIAI is accountable for innovations.","Since 2018 the Ministry of Education and Science, higher education institutes (HEIs), public research institutes (PRIs) and society representatives have discussed issues raised by the scientific community on how to increase the transparency of decisions on grant and program-oriented funding process. These discussions featured open voting and online broadcasting of meetings of experts. Topics of discussion included defining clear criteria selection for projects of public scientific and technical expertise, introducing an assessment for the validity of requested funding amounts, and the weight assigned to the various selection criteria.

R&D funding relies on basic, grant and programme-targeted funding. There are special rules for their provision. The grant and programme-targeted funding are available on a competitive basis. In 2019 the Science Committee of the Kazakh Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) developed a methodology for evaluating research projects and scientific activities of the scientific research institutes.

The main ongoing issues around the government support for the public research system are:
-	increasing competitive funding for research;
-	increasing institutional funding for PRIs;
-	increasing the commercialization of research projects' results (applied science);
-	improving skills of researchers in public PRIs and HEIs;
-	enhancing international co-operation in science, technology and innovation;
-	increasing the number of publications in peer-reviewed journals;
-	arranging training events and providing other measures of non-financial support; and,
-	developing the venture capital funding.","In 2018, the Council for Technological Policy of the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry (MDDIAI) approved the methods for developing technology policy in sectors of economy. Research projects are implemented through grant and programme-oriented funding within the priority areas for science development approved by the Higher Scientific and Technical Commission. The priorities focus on contributing to the country's social, scientific, technical and industrial development and achieving corresponding national social and economic goals. The Council also established a Roadmap for Technological Development in the area of new materials. The Higher Scientific and Technical Commission under the Kazakh Government has approved seven priorities for science development for 2018-2020: (i) Rational use of natural resources; (ii) Energy and engineering; (iii) ICT, space technologies, natural sciences; (iv) Life and health sciences; (v) Agriculture; (vi) National Security; (vii) Education. 

The main ongoing issues are:
-	structuring stable relationships between industry actors, the private sector, academic communities and government;
-	cooperating with international organizations in the area of technology-intensive entrepreneurship;
-	increasing commercialization of research projects' results (applied science);
-	stimulating the development of advanced technologies in economic sectors;
-	providing consulting services and other forms of support for technology extension;
-	establishing and supporting the ecosystem of business incubators and accelerators as well as supporting innovations in early stages of financing;
-	stimulating the early venture capital funding of innovative projects and arranging external financing for developing technological innovations geared towards economic growth.","Kazakhstan faces challenges in providing incentives for businesses to fund research. Linkages between research institutions and business companies are still insufficient. The Government has launched several public support initiatives to enhance knowledge transfer, e.g. establishing TTOs at universities. However, most of them have tight resource constraints and struggle to attract businesses.
Since 2017 a key strategic directive has been the provision of advisory services on state support for industrial and innovative activities. As part of this work, suggestions have been drawn up for system-wide measures in the area of technology and innovation development. These suggestions have been integrated in Kazakhstan’s 2018-2025 Strategic Development Plan. 2018 also saw the adoption of the law “On introducing amendments and additions to certain legislative acts on risk (venture) capital financing”. 

The main ongoing issues are:
-	involving the private sector in co-funding R&D projects (up to 50 %);
-	creating innovation clusters supported by technoparks, business incubators, centers for commercialization and technology transfer, venture funds, and engineering centers that work in close cooperation with relevant industries;
-	creating an ecosystem for academic spin-offs that provides access to capital and business advisory services (e.g. marketing and legal support) for young researchers who want to transform their ideas and technologies into start-ups; and
-	promoting research contracts that solve technological challenges set by industry actors.","The main ongoing issues are:
-	producing not only PhDs and scientists addressing societal needs, but also inventors and entrepreneurs needed to diversify the country’s economy and create jobs;
-	training researchers to: (i) make proposals and applications for scientific projects, including domestic and (with additional emphasis) international grants; (ii) be prepared in the area of technological entrepreneurship; and (iii) improve their skills in research methods and increasing their language proficiencies; and,
-	training enhancing entrepreneurial competences, including venture capital funding, technology development and business incubation.","The main ongoing discussions center on applying fundamentally new technologies, integrated closed-loop production systems and innovative approaches to power generation for increasing resource productivity. This includes water, land, biological resources, together with resource management efficiency, increasing population well-being and the quality of the environment.",
Korea,"Among the main policy debates are the following:
-	To achieve disruptive innovations in response to the imminent Fourth Industrial Revolution, possible approaches to ensuring effective public-private R&D partnership are being discussed and explored. 
-	For the development and acquisition of critical materials and equipment technologies to be used by industries, the need for a new promotion and coordination scheme is emerging. 
-	The improvement of the national R&D evaluation system now requires the reinforcement of qualitative evaluation and a reduced evaluation burden.","As part of the restructuring of the Project-Based System (PBS), the government has asked research institutes to submit their new ""roles and responsibilities"". Currently, the ratio of project-based funding at the government research institutes (GRIs) is in the range of 30-60%. Depending on the redefined roles and responsibilities of the GRIs, this ratio may drop in a more stable research environment, where the proportion of organisation-based block funding is set to increase.","The government has proposed ""to promote startups and encourage innovation"" and ""to create a sound environment for the growth of SMEs"" as a high priority in the national STI policy agenda. Specifically, this policy agenda aims to:
1)	enact the Venture Investment Promotion Act (tentatively named),
2)	expand the size of venture investment to the level of advanced economies,
3)	actively support innovative startups by excellent entrepreneurs with technologic expertise,
4)	remove obstacles to make another leap forward, and
5)	double the support for SMEs' R&D activities, including financial assistance and non-monetary benefits (e.g. R&D tax incentives, research loans, etc.).

Although most agree on these policy directions, a debate remains on how to develop and implement appropriate and effective policy measures.","Despite various policy measures for matching supply and demand for advanced technologies, considerable gaps (or mismatches) are still observed, which constitute major obstacles in technology transfer and sharing between science and industry. Excessive regulations in research and innovation (e.g. on the commercialisation of new technologies) are widely pointed out as one of the main obstacles. Diverse policy measures (including regulation sandboxes) are being discussed and experimentally installed to help alleviate such excessive regulations.","Three policy issues are discussed (rather than debated) on human resources development in research and innovation:
-	How to keep nurturing high-quality research talent in the face of a declining population and changes in Korea’s industrial structure?
-	How to reform educational (mainly university) systems and to strengthen the research-oriented universities so as to improve the research capacities of young scientists and engineers (mainly graduate students)?
-	How to create high-quality jobs for scientists and engineers, and improve mid-career working conditions (e.g. career development and job transition)?

While policy directions on these issues are largely agreed on, a range of specific policy measures are still being examined.","One of the hottest societal challenges issues in Korea is its aging society, since the birth rate in 2018 fell below 1, and 10 million of the population will be over 65 by 2025. In response, national policies are developing largely in two directions. One direction is to reverse the birth rate decline, primarily through social welfare policies. Another is to prepare for an aging society, mainly by focusing on promoting innovation for high-quality senior care and health services through STI policies.

Another hot issue is air pollution resulting from industrial and transportation activities, as well as from cross-border pollution. This controversial debate focuses on what proportions are due to domestic and/or international causes. Policy directions focus both on reducing domestic sources of pollution and on collaborating with neighboring countries on the issue.

Both hot issues require a whole-of-government approach and policy coordination across various ministries. To overcome the silo among policy areas and ministries, the Korean government has established policy coordination bodies at high levels. For instance, to coordinate policies for an aging society, the Presidential Committee on Aging Society and Population Policy (https://www.betterfuture.go.kr) was established at the Presidential level in 2010. To address the air pollution issue, a special committee for clean air (http://www.cleanair.go.kr) was installed under the leadership of the Prime Minister. In both cases, STI is considered the main policy tool.",
Latvia,"Institutional Consolidation of the Latvian Science Policy Implementation System
In response to the Horizon 2020 Policy Support Facility experts’ recommendations for Latvia, developed as part of the 2018 report “The Latvian Research Funding System”, the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) has begun to implement major reforms of the Latvian science policy implementation system. This involves consolidating its smaller administrative institutions and agencies (i.e. the Latvian Council of Science, Study and Science administration and State Education and Development Agency). This process will create a one-stop agency responsible for all science policy implementation through a pro-active management approach and greater flexibility in programme design (including greater in-house analytical capacity). The conceptual report, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on October 14th, 2019 Order Nr. 495 (protocol. Nr. 46 29. §), presents a detailed action plan for implementation in 2020. The consolidation process will result in a newly formed strong, unified institution for the implementation of science policy – the Latvian Council of Science, which will officially begin its work on July 1st 2020. 
Further development of our Smart Specialization Strategy (RIS3)
Latvia’s first detailed RIS3 monitoring results show a clear need for a more detailed approach towards R&I funding instruments in the next planning period. The government would like to move from a broader approach where programmes and activities are implemented in RIS3 areas towards an ecosystem approach, focusing on a more detailed and diverse policy mix tailored towards the specific needs in each of the five RIS3 specialisation areas. R&I funding instruments will be created focusing on specific sub-areas within the broad RIS3 areas.
Quality in research-based higher education – Improving higher education institution governance and strengthening research based higher education
The cornerstones of this reform are: a more effective institutional governance structure, diversification of funding and development of human capital. The reform is proposed to address the weaknesses and deficiencies of the higher educational system, such as low international competitiveness, lack of clear development strategies, study program fragmentation and separation of research and academic activities, as pointed out by local stakeholders and international experts.
The objectives of the reform are to:
-	Increase autonomy for internal structural entities and strengthen the principle of external accountability of the institution by ensuring a broad representation of internal and especially external interested parties on the Governing Board 
-	Define the principles for involving external stakeholders in strategic development decisions
-	Open the positions of rectors and vice-rectors for external activities, incl. international competition
-	Establish clearer requirements and more transparent procedures for selecting and approving candidates for all administrative posts
-	Establish HEI’s development strategies as an integral part of improvements in institutional operation
-	Improve university-internal governance mechanisms by reviewing the division of responsibilities, and by strengthening the role of the Governing Board, consisting predominantly of external stakeholders, in decision-making
-	Develop mechanisms for consolidating higher education and research resources.","State budget allocations to the public research system are on the political agenda. Significant increases are expected in the 2020 State Budget. Up until 2020, only the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) and the Ministry of Economics have implemented State Research Programmes. But this is set to change with the adoption of the law ""Amendments to the Law on Scientific Activity"" and its entry into force on July 12th 2018 (see Article 35) and the subsequent approval of Cabinet Regulation No. 560 (on September 4th 2018) ""Procedure for the implementation of state research programme projects"", which enable sectoral ministries to create and finance State Research Programmes in their respective areas of competence. 

A new Fundamental and Applied Research Project scheme (F&A research scheme) was launched in 2018. Compared to previous years, funding has been increased from 4.4 million EUR annually to 9.5 EUR annually. This scheme provides a platform for bottom-up research proposal implementation in all six fields of science (according to the Fields of Science classification) where the focal goal and evaluation criteria is research excellence. All projects are evaluated by international experts only. 

The Guidelines for the Development of Science, Technology and Innovation for 2014-2020 set a goal to reduce the number of state-funded research institutions from 40 to 20 (by 2020). In 2018, this goal was reached (21 state-funded institutions in 2018). Therefore, current R&D policy moves away from institutional consolidation towards strengthening research capacity in these institutions.","Future plans for innovation support relate to developing strategic value chain ecosystems within the specific areas that have showed the highest development and competitiveness potential both locally and internationally. The development of such ecosystems will be supported by the Ministry of Economics, while the Ministry of Education and Science will be responsible for fostering research (in universities and research institutions) and producing highly talented specialists (through higher education and vocational education).

All major policies are currently being redeveloped:

-	The Ministry of Economics is working on the development of a national industrial policy for 2021-2027 and Smart specialisation strategy. The main focus will be the specialisation of key national industries and the development of strategic value chain ecosystems within each of them. As new competitive advantages emerge, a distinct business model shift is needed, moving from short-term profitability to long-term productivity and robust sustainable profitability, as well as cross-industry partnerships.

-	The Ministry of Education and Science is working on developing Guidelines on Science and Research policy for 2021-2027. In parallel, a new National development plan is being developed.","Many of the major policies are currently under preparation. 

-	Currently, the Ministry of Economics is working on the development of a national industrial policy for 2021-2027 and Smart specialisation strategy. The main focus will be on the key national industries with the highest development potential which leads towards the development of the strategic value chain ecosystems within each of the specialised areas. 

-	The development of sustainable ecosystems will ensure productive knowledge transfer, as well as promote cooperation between the academic and private sectors. The Ministry of Education and Science is working on developing Guidelines on Science and Research policy for 2021-2027. In parallel, a new National development plan is being developed.","There is increased focus on reforming and developing new frameworks for academic staff and academic and scientific careers, as well as reforming doctoral studies by aligning them with active research work. This means increased support for PhD students, both through scholarships and grants, as well as increased state support for research (through grants, state research programmes, etc.). 

The quality of doctoral studies will be strengthened by implementing the following major changes:
-	a higher education institution wishing to implement a doctoral study programme and to grant a doctorate shall demonstrate sustainable scientific activity in line with its development strategy and provide bachelors’ and masters’ degree study programmes;
-	the quality assessment of a doctoral study programme – the licensing and accreditation process – shall be distinguished from the evaluation of other study programmes (bachelors’ and masters’ degree study programmes);
-	implementation of doctoral study programmes for universities shall be organised in centrally established departments – doctoral schools; 
-	all academic staff of a doctoral study programme shall have a doctorate, except in individual, justified cases;
-	for each doctoral dissertation, a promotion council shall be established with the composition of five members; at least three members shall not be in employment or other civil relations with a higher education institution that implements the doctoral study programme; three of the members of the promotion council shall be reviewers; also, one reviewer of these three reviewers shall be a recognised scientist from abroad.
A new model for academic careers is planned with implementation of a tenure track system, strengthened academic and research integrity, and creation of a more conducive environment for attracting foreign academic staff. 
In addition, the European Commission is conducting a Policy Support Facility exercise on Latvia’s human capital for research and innovation.","Programmes exist at multiple levels (EU level, interregional, national level) that fund research to address societal challenges. At the national level, since 2018, the primary R&I instrument for addressing societal challenges is the State Research Programmes (SRP), through which sectoral ministries can commission top-down research. Currently, SRP's have only been funded for Latvian language, Latvian cultural heritage, and Energy. Pending the 2020 budget appropriation, several additional SRPs are likely to be funded.

The SDGs are translated into policies through the National Development Plan. Although strong synergies exist, the Latvian Smart Specialisation Strategy and Priority Directions in Science could be more directly linked to the SDGs.",
Lithuania,"In 2018 Lithuania adopted an Innovation Reform that will significantly change the country’s innovation ecosystem. The basis for the reform is the Law on Technologies and Innovation, together with amendments to the Law on Higher Education and Research, that establish the structure of the technology and innovation system and the institutions making and implementing the technology and innovation policy. There are three key elements of the reform: (i) to revise interactions in the Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) ecosystem; (ii) to revise innovation support schemes; and, (iii) to attract talents and R&D oriented foreign direct investment.

In this context, Lithuania took key decisions to promote the growth of an efficient innovation ecosystem. This ecosystem is directly dependent on robust and clear inter-institution coordination, along with clearly defined responsibilities of policy makers. These responsibilities were defined in the special Law on Technologies and Innovation: (a) the Ministry of Economy and Innovation is responsible for the technology and innovation policy; and, (b) the Ministry of Education and Science and Sports is in charge of research policy and the preparation of highly skilled professionals.

The goal of the innovation reform is to boost productivity growth and increase the country’s competitiveness. The focus is to maintain the momentum and reduce the productivity gap in the medium term. Our knowledge-based sectors such as biotechnology industries, laser manufacturing, machinery, electronics, mechatronics and information technology are expanding. Lithuania is making efforts to expand high-technology sectors with strong R&D and innovation potential, such as life science industry, information technology (pertaining to both manufacturing and services) and engineering industries. 

In science and innovation diplomacy, the following goals have been set: (i) positioning Lithuania as a reliable and attractive region for innovation; (ii) promoting active participating in international STI programmes of Lithuanian actors; (iii) seeking internationally competitive results in the field of STI; (iv) attracting foreign investment in R&D; and, (v) encouraging Lithuanian entities to join global chains of higher added value.","Strategic planning on government support for the Lithuanian public research system centres on the following core topics: (i) strengthening of human resources; (iii) creating of research-based knowledge; and, (iii) promoting research entrepreneurship. These three tasks form the knowledge triangle (creation, circulation and application) that have been outlined as essential during the discussions and consultations with the main universities, research institutions and non-governmental actors (e.g. Knowledge Economy Forum) when drafting the National Progress Programme. They are expected to raise Lithuanian competitiveness and economic growth.

Discussions surrounding the national research policy framework also raised need to build international linkages within the Lithuanian research sector (e.g. joining international research infrastructures and other international networks), promoting researcher mobility, gender balance and open access to research information (publications and data). In addition, the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport regards research-based innovations as a priority.

The system of assessment and financing of R&D activities of universities and research institutes was changed in 2017. A dual system of assessment consisting of (i) yearly-arranged formal assessments and (ii) expert assessments conducted every five years was introduced. The first expert assessment was accomplished in 2018 with the help of international experts. 60% of R&D funding is allocated to universities and research institutes according to the results of these expert assessments, and 40% according to the results of the last three yearly formal assessments.","A key priority of the Ministry of Economy and Innovation is the development of the start-up ecosystem in Lithuania. For 2020 the aim is to achieve 1000 start-ups. Currently, the number of start-ups has already reached over 900 in Lithuania.

To achieve this, a favourable business environment will be created with the following measures, among others:

-	Improving procedures of the “Start-up Visa” program by adjusting the evaluation procedure.
-	Creating the “Start-up Employee Visa” procedure to attract, retain and integrate foreign talents. 
-	Launching an information infrastructure as a “one-stop shop” providing efficient and effective services to highly qualified specialists and at least in two foreign languages (English and Russian).
-	Increasing “Soft Landing” services of that provide advice for start-up founders, help foreign start-ups move to Lithuania and educate futurepreneurs and other actors in the ecosystem.
-	Motivating existing start-ups employees and attracting new ones by promoting options for shares acquisition (i.e., when receiving or acquiring shares after 3 years, neither personal income tax nor social security contributions are required).
-	Establishing two business incubators of the Nuclear Research Centre (CERN) in Vilnius and Kaunas. 
-	Streamlining and facilitating technology licensing procedures.
-	Establishing regulatory sandboxes, accelerators and incubators for Fintec","In Lithuania, private sector investments in R&D remain four times lower than the EU28 average. The share of researchers working in the business sector also stands at around 29%, well below the EU28 average (close to 51%). Topics in national debates on research policy include actions for expanding knowledge-intensive business sector, increasing the share of business investments in R&D and augmenting business R&D-absorptive capacities. In particular, targets being contemplated include increasing the number of R&D-intensive start-ups and spin-offs, raising joint activities with universities and institutes and the instruments to enhance collaboration between science and business, attracting international investment to the Lithuanian R&D sector and establishing industrial doctorate opportunities.

The ongoing education and science reform in Lithuania will strengthen the public R&D system, thereby increasing co-operation with businesses. It covers a number of relevant policy changes, including the consolidation of public universities, actions to create and empower the Research and Technology Organisation, developing new funding models and a revamping of researchers careers. A two-stage assessment system and funding in R&D was introduced in 2017, focusing on research quality, social and economic impact, activities related to international R&D programmes and science-business cooperation. Innovation and technology transfer centres in higher education institutes play a key role for science-industry collaboration. Various schemes are established to promote R&D-based projects that are commercially promising and lead to results that could be tailored to market deployment and attract follow–up investments.

Currently, ongoing discussions and ideas being explored for new aims and instruments include:
-	Developing the scientific knowledge base to increase the country's competitiveness and contribute to the solution of challenges faced in national, EU and global contexts.
-	Encouraging the development of business leveraging scientific knowledge and developing a culture of entrepreneurship at higher education institutes and research institutes.

These plans, under discussion, will possibly shape the forthcoming National Progress Programme for 2021-2030.","As a constituent part of the strategic objective on sustainable economic growth, the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport (MoESS) proposes strengthening human resources and competencies for research and creating research-based innovations. This objective encounters several issues that are being discussed within the national R&I policy framework. 
Firstly, the main problem highlighted by the MoESS (and the academic and researcher communities) is related to the brain drain and attraction/maintenance of talents in the research field. The lack of international researchers results in a low number of internationally competitive research groups being able to find solutions for the national and global challenges faced nowadays.
Secondly, stakeholders from top universities and research institutes stress the necessity to develop the R&D potential as an essential requirement for having a competitive economy. Both governmental bodies and researchers note the need for higher investments in human resources. A higher availability of financial instruments should lead to increased attractiveness of the R&D sector (e.g. subsidies covering higher salaries and financial instruments for research activities). Discussions are also ongoing on how to make the researcher profession more attractive and popular among the youth. All the actors agree on the need for a consistent national policy with regard to human resources, listing it among top-priority issues.","Lithuania is preparing the National Progress Programme (NPP) for the upcoming decade (2021-2030). The NPP will be a holistic strategy that addresses the main national challenges in the economy, social development and the environment. Various discussions will inform the development of this main medium-term strategic planning document, including the ways and actions on how the national R&I policy can address societal challenges. Part of the preparation process is an intense debate on the NPP’s goals and objectives. 

One important goal of NPP is to move towards a sustainable economy based on scientific research, advanced technologies and innovations. To achieve this goal, a list of objectives are being formulated. This list includes objectives like creating and diffusing advanced technologies and innovations, promoting digitalization, entrepreneurship, and small- and medium-sized business. The NPP will also address issues like education and specialization, cooperation of public and private sectors, climate change and infrastructure. These objectives are being formulated to help solve social and environmental issues as well. They are also formulated in accordance with the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. These debates include the participation of all ministries, various experts, as well as representatives from the business sector and civil society. 

The creation, dissemination and use of research-based knowledge is being discussed as a core principle of national science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. The Lithuanian public research system faces the challenge of how to reach higher impacts in the economy and for societal welfare as a whole. In order to face this challenge, it is of a high importance to transform research-based knowledge into high value-added products. Present societal challenges also require more interdisciplinary research as well as continuous communication between public and private sector stakeholders. In addition, further integration between STI policy and sectoral policies is being explored as a means of commercialising research results.",
Luxembourg,"This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The past debates on the various vertical and horizontal co-ordination mechanisms – particularly those related setting national priorities and inter-ministerial co-ordination – have largely been settled. The existing national priorities are mostly accepted and only require further adaptation. Informal communication channels between ministries are considered sufficient.

One outstanding issue is whether the informal co-ordination of the actors performing public research (organised through a gathering – known as the ""3LIU"" – of the three public research institutes plus the University of Luxembourg) should be institutionalised, and what roles the ministries and funding agencies might play in such co-ordination. Another outstanding issue is whether Luxembourg needs a formal strategy for public research, or even a broader national innovation strategy.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The main debate concerns establishing thematic and horizontal priorities in national research policy.

i) Thematic priorities: a broad consensus exists on the need to streamline Luxembourgs public-research portfolio and focus on key areas, hence reducing the number of thematic areas covered. The actors and stakeholders involved hold differing views on how this could be done. This debate takes place at different levels. At the political level (both in the Government and Parliament) the discussions mostly take place in the context of budget negotiations. At the University, the debate centres on the allocation of block grants between the faculties and interdisciplinary centres, as well as among the faculties. At the National Research Fund (FNR) – which has a structuring effect on the public research system – the debate focuses on the number of research priorities, and the nature and volume of the different funding programmes. So far, this debate has not led to direct changes in thematic priorities, but streamlining is expected to take place during the next round of negotiations.

ii) Horizontal priorities: the impact of public research, and its potential contribution to economic and social development, is a regular topic of discussion, including the notion of ""excellence versus relevance"". As a result, the FNR has expanded the portfolio of instruments and initiatives in both its thematic and human resource-development programmes, so that they cover (to a certain extent) both public-private and public-public partnerships. The ongoing revision of the University of Luxembourg’s legal framework has triggered a debate on the University’s long-term development – and, more generally, the national public research system. These debates also bring into question the sustainability of a research system organised along dual lines, i.e. the University and the public research institutes.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

One of the main policy questions related to business innovation concerns how to stimulate business expenditure on research and development (BERD), as well as retain existing research activities in Luxembourg and attract new ones. Official statistics show an overall decrease in BERD. While this owes in part to changes in the methodology for measuring BERD, it also stems from changes in structural patterns (bearing in mind that most research and development [R&D]-performing firms in Luxembourg are legally headquartered abroad). Some players have downsized their activities, while several sectors (e.g. finance and logistics) are traditionally not very active in research. For the manufacturing sectors, on the other hand, the objective is to either maintain or increase the current levels of R&D spending.

This debate is actually an ongoing discussion with the private sector, with the aim of making it easier for firms to gain access to highly qualified staff and academic research capacity. Given the limited array of policy options, the goal is to strengthen the private sector’s engagement in R&D activities in Luxembourg, rather than relying solely on incentives and policy instruments.

The economy is currently heavily dependent on the finance sector and associated industries. In the medium term, a major policy goal is to step up economic diversification by promoting four key sectors: space, logistics, information and communication technologies, and biotechnology.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The debate centres on how to best organise knowledge transfer between public research, the private sector and society at large. Although all stakeholders agree on the paramount importance of such a transfer, they are still discussing how to achieve it. One idea previously under serious consideration was the establishment of a common central structure dedicated to the transfer and commercialisation of knowledge developed by the University and public research institutes. This idea has now been superseded by the development of common principles and guidelines related to contractual frameworks and royalty attribution, with individual institutions retaining overall responsibility and activities for knowledge transfer and commercialisation.

It bears repeating that knowledge-transfer activities go beyond patenting and licensing. In recent years, the FNR and Luxinnovation have set up further instruments to foster public-private collaborations. Inter-sectoral exchanges of human resources and knowledge provide a better understanding of demand and supply, and encourage the creation of absorptive capacities on all sides.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The match between skill supply and labour demand is the crux of the debate. It starts with the need to increase the pool of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students, and leads to the quality and adaptability of curricula – which itself is intimately linked to the employability of University of Luxembourg graduates. The ill-defined labour demand at the industry level, as well as the time lag between demand and supply, do not make the task easier. Other issues of concern are how to better achieve a gender balance (less than 20% of full professors are female), and how to (re-)attract talents to Luxembourg. The absence of a graduate tracking system, and the question of how such a system might be implemented, are recurring topics on the agenda.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Stakeholders in Luxembourg more or less agree that research and innovation should contribute not only to the countrys economic development, but also to solving societal challenges, such as developing an education system that better takes into account the very heterogeneous population and multilingualism; and addressing the question of trans-border commuting, and its impacts on traffic, mobility and the environment, as well as the organisation of work. This societal-challenge orientation requires consulting different stakeholders (including citizens), and entails a change in researchers’ mindset.

Luxembourg’s national identity, especially in light of the country’s development in the aftermath of the Second World War, has been the subject of a long-standing debate. The result was the creation of the third interdisciplinary centre at the University of Luxembourg, focusing on digital and contemporary history.",
Malta,"Malta is currently developing its new R&I Strategy and Smart Specialisation Strategy for post-2020. This process involves an extensive review of ongoing measures through both the recently established Monitoring system as well as a bottom up consultative process with all stakeholders. As part of this process, a Peer Review of the National R&I System was concluded in June 2019. The Peer Review provided valuable insights on how to improve the governance of STI Policy in Malta at both the political and the technical level. Work is currently ongoing on analysing these recommendations and identifying the most appropriate way forward for their recommendations.","The ongoing policy debates focus around the persistent sub-optimal level of investment in R&D and the risk of missing the political target of 2% Gross R&D expenditure / GDP by 2020. Over the past months, an extensive review of the statistical data process was also undertaken.

The Core Group, which meets at Permanent Secretary level, is responsible for deciding on priorities for action as well as timeframes, resources and budgets on the basis of recommendations made by the Steering Group. The Steering Group meets at the level of Heads of relevant Public Entities and Organisations or their high-level delegates. Further advocacy, through the Core and Steering groups responsible for R&I, remains ongoing for increased government support and funding to R&D, which is also backed by the recommendations of the June 2019 PSF report.","A number of measures are available for business support to innovation and these remain ongoing. There is an increased drive towards the adoption of new enabling technologies, to better support innovation across a wide range of business sectors, guided by the National Blockchain Strategy, the National AI Strategy, as well as the Smart Specialisation thematic areas within the National R&I Strategy 2014-2020. 

A new agency, Tech.mt was set up in 2019 with the aim to give local tech companies the opportunity to showcase their work, expose tech professionals to innovative technology, and drive academic research. It will also mentor and coach business development for tech companies.","The current National R&I policy is highly focused on the importance of applied research and its commercialisation. The June 2019 PSF report recommended that more effort should be made to externalise ongoing research efforts to make them more generally accessible to the public. To this end a dedicated Knowledge Transfer Programme (KTP) is currently being developed. In addition, in July 2019, Malta embarked on an exercise supported by the EU's Policy Support Facility to develop a National Policy on Open Access, which should be finalised by end of the first quarter of 2020.","The PSF Review of the National R&I System provided valuable insights into the policies and measures required to support human resource capacity for research and innovation. Beyond targeted support for R&D funding, such as the setting up of a dedicated fund for basic research, the report also called for improved career opportunities in research. The report also recommends improving mobility opportunities for researchers, both between industry and academia, as well internationally (without however creating too high a risk of brain drain). These recommendations are currently being considered for eventual inclusion in the post-2020 National R&I Strategy.","The current policy consultations with stakeholders on the design of the national R&I Strategy 2020 and beyond are addressing areas of national priority and smart specialisation that relate to the societal challenges, in particular health and maritime, as well as sustainable buildings and manufacturing. While the Sustainable Development Goals provide an important backdrop to the national R&I strategy 2020, the goals are not currently addressed in a direct way through the Strategy’s current set of measures. This approach is flagged for discussion as part of the ongoing process to restructure the national R&I system and upscale national investments in R&I.",
Mexico,"This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Mexican science, technology and innovation (STI) policy intends to make investment in the development of STI a pillar of the country’s sustainable economic development. Hence, the most important issue is to increase national investments in STI. Another major goal is to strengthen the links between higher education institutions (HEIs) and research centres, and the public, social and private sectors. Special attention is also being paid to science communication, by establishing an open-science programme to make science and scientific information accessible to every citizen.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The public research system is the subject of several important debates. The first question is to increase the number of researchers in the national research system, particularly in priority areas determined by the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) within the framework of the Special Programme for STI 2014-18. The second issue is to create and promote interdisciplinary research groups addressing complex challenges, like climate change. The third priority is to encourage the participation of Mexican researchers in global research activities. A related issue is evaluating the scientific production of researchers, to ensure that research results meet quality and impact requirements, and cover diverse scientific disciplines.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The main policy debates revolve around finding ways to encourage firms and entrepreneurs to invest in science, research and innovation activities, given that the Mexican Government remains the main funder of research and development (R&D) in the country. As a way to improve competitiveness, the Government has in recent years established business R&D grants and tax credits to encourage large and small firms to invest in R&D.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The main challenge is funding collaborative R&D projects, linking public research institutions, HEIs, research centres and companies. To this end, the CONACYT has promoted the creation of clusters and public-private consortia, to develop R&D projects at the sectoral and regional levels.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The current focus of human-resource policy for STI in Mexico is improving the scholarship system for postgraduate students; most postgraduate scholarships are granted by the CONACYT. A related priority is incorporating postgraduate academic programmes in the National Register of Quality Education Programmes, which would help improve their global competitiveness.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Strengthening scientific culture so that citizens can appropriate the benefits of science and technology is a key goal of Mexico’s STI policy. Communicating science and providing open access to scientific information are essential elements to this end. The public communication of science involves using both specialised and general media (e.g. specialised journals, television and radio shows, and the Internet), and promoting science museums, planetariums and science conferences to bring science to the general public. Open access to science seeks to ensure that all scientific literature that is totally or partially financed by public funds is accessible to all for reading, copying, printing and distributing by any other legal means, without financial or technical barriers.",
Morocco,"This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The main issues of debate on the governance of national science, technology and innovation (STI) policy are as follows:

1) Research funding, particularly through public-private partnerships: public resources are limited, and the national gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) remains relatively low (around 0.73% of gross domestic product [GDP]) compared to countries with similar incomes. This does not allow the national research and innovation system to achieve the expected outcomes.

2) The socio-economic impact of scientific research: while large public budgets are spent on research and development (R&D), its outputs and impacts on innovation and technological development in Morocco are limited, even though R&D is a real lever for the country’s socio-economic development in other areas.

3) Evaluation of scientific research and evolution/trends of STI indicators: the institutional evaluation of research and innovation activities is not sufficiently anchored in Morocco. Researchers can advance in their careers without displaying a prominent scientific and/or technological production that would justify it.

The absence of an STI observatory (or similar unit) provides information on the evolution of STI indicators, and Morocco’s position in this regard at the regional and international levels leads to recurring questions about producing and updating these indicators.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Great efforts were made during the last decade to improve research funding and increase GERD. Even though the GERD/GDP ratio rose from 0.37% in 1999 and 0.63% in 2006, to 0.73% in 2010 (according to the available data), it remains low compared to UNESCO and OECD recommendations (i.e. a ratio of at least 1%). Moreover, more than 70% of GERD is allocated to personnel salaries. Hence, all stakeholders – particularly policy makers – agree on the need to strengthen and diversify research-funding sources, particularly through developing public-public and public-private partnerships to support R&D; encouraging enterprises to invest in R&D activities; promoting international co-operation in STI and draining foreign funds; and encouraging contributions from non-profit organisations.

The number of students enrolled in Moroccan higher education institutions nearly doubled over the last decade (from 385 653 in 2006 to 750 130 in 2016, a 95% increase). The number of academics/professors only grew by 40% (from 9 395 in 2006 to 13 170 in 2016), owing to the retirement of numerous academics in recent years. This has had a negative impact on the overall quality of higher education and scientific research in Morocco. A set of measures were therefore adopted to counter the student/professor gap in the coming years, which will see an even higher number of academic retirements.

It is recognised worldwide that academic staff (teachers-researchers) cannot advance their careers without undertaking minimal scientific research to move up levels before reaching the highest grade. In the Moroccan context, hundreds (or even thousands) of academic staff have reached the highest grade without significant scientific or technological production (apart from their doctoral thesis), even though they are paid for it. National regulatory laws on the advancement of academic staff should therefore be revised to account for R&D activities.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The main policy debates around government support for business innovation and entrepreneurship focus on socio-economic issues, including energy efficiency and renewable energies; environmental protection and sustainable development; job creation and unemployment reduction.

The Moroccan energy market has grown at an increasingly dynamic pace and is progressively opening up to private investment, particularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. A national energy strategy was launched in 2009. Several institutions were established to implement this strategy, and foster energy-related R&D and innovation, including: i) the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy; ii) the Ouarzazate Solar Power Station (also called Noor Power Station); iii) the Institute for Research in Solar Energy and Renewable Energies; iv) Solar Cluster, an association representing 260 enterprises and actors in the solar energy sector; and v) Poles of competences in energy, a national network of research laboratories from various universities and research centres. The measures also include funding dozens of research and innovation projects on renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Like many developing countries, Morocco faces a set of environmental constraints (water stress, land degradation, overly strong energy dependence, vulnerability to climate change, various types of pollution). It has a limited number of economic-growth and social-development policies aiming to create jobs, and reduce social and spatial disparities. A shift in the country’s economic modelling in favour of a green and inclusive economy, driven by the private sector and able to create jobs, reduce poverty and curtail territorial-development imbalances, is required to tackle these issues. In 2012, Morocco adopted a National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development. The Charter aims to boost sustainable socio-economic development by protecting natural resources, reducing emissions and energy costs, creating jobs, increasing economic opportunity, and developing an innovative entrepreneurship ecosystem. Many instruments support the Charter’s implementation by all national public and private stakeholders, including universities and research centres.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

National universities and research centres engage in few activities related to technology transfer and opening up to the socio-economic environment. Despite recent efforts by public authorities and relevant institutions, many obstacles persist, such as the lack of appropriate structures for technology transfer to businesses; a limited supply of highly qualified human resources; and the absence of an adequate legislative and regulatory framework to facilitate and promote such activities.

During the last decade, the national authority in charge of scientific research has implemented a set of instruments, including university-business interfaces, innovation cities, innovative-enterprise incubators, technology and innovation support centres, technology-diffusion networks, and industrial engineering networks. However, these structures cannot perform properly without an adequate legislative and regulatory framework.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The main policy debates surrounding human resources for research and innovation focus on the retirement of many professors and researchers in public universities and higher education and/or scientific research institutions in the coming years. The question is how to address this looming human-resource gap, given the expected spike in student numbers.

Policy makers agree they need to tackle this issue based on three solutions, discussed in the Parliament:

i) The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research needs to be provided with more new budget items to hire new faculty members compared to previous years.
ii) Managers with PhDs must see their administrative positions transformed into faculty (assistant professor) positions. More than 2 000 executives and engineers have benefited from this operation until now.
iii) For the first time since the implementation of the 1997 reform of doctoral studies and access to higher education professions, PhD students should be recruited as assistant professors, based on a fixed-term contract (for a maximum of three years). It should be noted that the 1997 reform has limited access to faculty member positions at universities to PhD graduates only.

Another issue is that few Moroccan researchers and professors publish scientific papers in international peer-review journals, particularly in the human and social sciences. This stems from at least three factors: i) the implementation of higher education reform according to the EU-Bologna process (bachelor-masters-doctorate) since 2000 has been consumed professors’ time, with a negative impact on research activities; ii) the resources for funding research activities and equipping the laboratories with the necessary scientific materials/equipment are insufficient; and iii) the evaluation grid for career and grade advancement of the academic staff (teachers-researchers/professors) does not emphasise enough research activities.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The main issue in the current public policy debate on innovation for societal well-being and cohesion is the role of scientific research – particularly in human and social sciences – in tackling societal challenges (e.g. unemployment, terrorism, health inequalities and education).

These issues are often the subject of parliamentary questions to the national research authority. Among the six national research priorities, three deal with these issues: i) health, environment and quality of life; ii) education and training; and iii) human sciences and contemporary challenges in Moroccan society.

These topics are also mentioned in various national research calls for proposals, including a specific call on human and social sciences launched in 2009, and a similar call currently under preparation. In addition, the National Observatory of Human Development launched a national call to evaluate the impact of the National Initiative for Human Development, with ten research projects funded within this framework.

Evidence exists that national research and innovation plays a key role in reaching a better understanding of societal challenges and problems. Funding research projects allows the academic community to help solve these problems. Nevertheless, their impact is not immediately noticeable.",
Netherlands,"Current policy debates address a number of questions, among which are the following:

1.	What relation is there between specific and generic innovation policies? The Netherlands puts huge emphasis on generic R&D support policies through tax deductions, which are easy to implement. However, more specific policies involve supporting specific themes (like energy transition), technologies (like photonics), or sectors (like life sciences). This creates the need for a governance and selection process, which also involves proper arrangements for monitoring and evaluation. 

2.	Public-private cooperation in designing and implementing STI policies. The Netherlands traditionally co-designs STI policies with public and private partners, E e.g. public support promoting SMEs adoption of new technologies is delegated to the ”top sector” private bodies of companies. Likewise, selecting grants for public-private collaboration (mainly targeting companies and applied research institutes and universities) is delegated to these bodies. Now that public support is shifting towards research and innovation (R&I) missions targeting societal challenges (health, agri-food, security, energy transition), new arrangements may be needed for public-private cooperation.

3.	Geopolitical considerations means the Netherlands must choose between 'safe and open' and 'insecure and more protected' technologies. While this is easy to administer for a number of goods (including dual use goods), this might be more difficult when it comes to technologies where the Netherlands would like to cooperate and make use of the knowledge other parties have. Given technology has increasingly geopolitical aspects, there is an urge for clear policies. How to deal with the need to stay at the forefront in promising technologies as AI? And how should cooperation with other countries look like? For example, the government recently published its ‘China Strategy’ that explains how the Netherlands looks at cooperation with China. This strategy aims at a balance between looking at technologies and cooperation in an open way and allowing cooperation, while also safeguarding national interests. The Strategy does not explain, however, what cooperation between universities should look like, for instance. There should be a balance between open cooperation and preventing leaking knowledge.

4.	A related question is how to continue the transition towards open science, in the Netherlands and internationally (e.g. in Horizon Europe and in bilateral partnerships), by engaging ever more researchers, businesses, publishers, data platforms and other actors, while taking into account competitiveness, security and other considerations.

5.	How to move from triple helix to quadruple helix models of innovation, which involves engaging a variety of societal stakeholders throughout the entire science and innovation process and in the governance structure of STI policy? 

6.	A question that is more relevant for science policy and technology policy than for innovation policy is how to secure sufficient opportunities for bottom-up, curiosity driven research? As societal challenges become a more prominent perspective for innovation policy and, to some extent, science policy, affecting the strategies of individual universities and research organisations, what are the consequences for bottom-up, curiosity driven research? 

7.	Specifically in science policy, a question is how the assessment of researchers could be widened and more flexible (looking at education, societal impact, contribution to research infrastructures, open science, etc., instead of the narrow focus on publications, grants, etc.)? One of the challenges is for the Netherlands to contribute to international developments in this respect, also to prevent other countries continuing to assess (Dutch) researchers based on publications and grants only.","The system of financing of the education and research system is an important policy debate. A large study on the costs of research and education in relation to the budget is in the process of being launched in late 2019. 

The debate about rewarding and recognizing scientific achievements has been launched with a large role for universities. Academics can excel in many areas, but thus far they have primarily been assessed based on research achievements. From now on, the Dutch public knowledge institutions and research funders want to consider academics’ knowledge and expertise more broadly in determining career policy and grant requirements. The aim is to ensure that the recognition and rewards system is better suited to the core tasks of the knowledge institutions in the areas of education, research, impact and patient care, and that the appreciation academics receive is better aligned with society’s needs. Research achievements have long determined academics’ career paths, but this dominance is becoming increasingly at odds with reality. Education and impact are also crucial to the success of a modern knowledge institution, as is patient care for our university medical centres.

There is also more emphasis on clear university profiles. There are opportunities to make the Netherlands a knowledge hub and a centre that competes with those elsewhere in the world. A clear profile helps to attract talented researchers from abroad. In addition, it can enable the forging of better connections with other international and national research institutions, companies and civil society organizations. It is also a way of putting the Netherlands more firmly on the map as a country that develops and uses world-class knowledge. University sectoral plans (‘sectorplannen’) and setting focal areas at universities of applied sciences are useful tools for this purpose. To this end, the instrument of sectoral plans has been funded and initiated both in beta and technical studies, as well as in the social sciences and humanities.","There are a number of ongoing policy debates, including:

1.	the regulation of new forms of financing for innovation, such as crowdsourcing. New, overly-strict regulation could possibly have a negative effect on the growth of such initiatives, which could be a welcome addition to the current financing landscape. However, excesses should also be avoided. 

2.	how can the Netherlands ensure that transition-oriented firms – in particular those that fall within the government’s mission-oriented policy – can be financed? What role does this encompass for existing initiatives that aim to increase the access to finance for innovative entrepreneurs?

Entrepreneurship in education is now well-established, and each university offers related courses to its students. The same goes for many secondary schools, where business plan contests, secondments in business, boot camps, and getting investment ready are already in place.

For start-ups and scale-ups, the NL has a special agency operating at arm's length: StartupDelta, renamed TechLeap in 2019. Its focus is on helping those starting or scaling-up a business, linking them to investors, and offering business opportunities, including soft landing places abroad, given the small size of the Dutch market.

To help SMEs pick up new knowhow, the government has set up tens of field labs. They offer expensive equipment accessible to SMEs for testing through small scale production, with coaching and training, e.g. for 3-D printing, handling composite materials, manufacturing integrated circuits, etc. Field labs also exist in agriculture (proeftuinen, pilot gardens) for experimenting with, for example, new ways to cultivate the soil, grow new crops, etc.","Since the 1990's, each university has set up its own technology transfer office. Since fields like life sciences and nanotechnology require very specialised knowhow, e.g. on IPR, these offices now work together much more closely. 

Many teaching professors are part-timers funded by business, and they act as a bridge between universities and business. 

In the past, universities working with companies was seen as a “sell-out” to commerce. Attitudes have since changed and such cooperation is much in vogue. For example, groups of masters students (“dreamteams”) work with companies to develop new products, e.g. a solar electric car, hyperloop, fast tools for medical diagnosis, etc.","The ambition is to achieve a more balanced approach to recognizing, valuing and stimulating academic excellence. Assessment of academic research and researchers within knowledge institutions is currently based on their number of publications, their impact factor and the number of grants they obtain. This emphasis is regarded by many in the academic world as too narrow.The aim of the universities is to enable a variety of career paths. Next to valuing academic research, there should also be appreciation for teaching skills, the impact of ones research on society and the demonstration of academic leadership. 

This does not mean that one person has to be equally good at all these tasks, as that would only increase the work pressure. Arranging a differentiated distribution of tasks within teams should reduce the pressure for individual excellence and place more emphasis on the achievements of the team as a whole. The government supports these developments and supports the field in strengthening this current movement to achieve the aforementioned ambition.","Societal challenges have become more relevant for designing and implementing STI policy in the Netherlands. 

In early 2019, many of the SDGs were incorporated into the mission-oriented Top sectors and into innovation policy more broadly: agriculture, water, food, health, security, clean energy, transport, and circular economy. The Top sector-programme now serves societal goals. Applied research organisations such as TNO will focus on research and innovation in these fields. 

There is no debate in the Netherlands about this shift in policy from Top sectors to societal challenges. Competitiveness and the SDGs are now widely seen as connected goals. One example: the Ministry of Economic Affairs was renamed in 2017 by adding 'and Climate Policy' to its name.

Mission-orientation is also affecting science policy, especially through the National Research Agenda (NWA), which aims for scientific breakthroughs that address societal challenges. Another example is that, gradually, societal impact is becoming a more important criterion in the assessment of research proposals and researchers. However, this trend comes with a number of questions, such as:
-	How to move from triple helix to quadruple helix models by engaging a variety of societal stakeholders throughout the entire science and innovation process and in the governance structure of STI policy? 
-	How to secure sufficient opportunities for bottom-up, curiosity driven research?",
New Zealand,"The rights and role of M?ori in the governance of the science, technology and innovation system is a subject of ongoing policy debate. The New Zealand Government has obligations to M?ori under the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 by both British settlers and M?ori chiefs. Interactions between M?ori and the Crown are guided today by Treaty principles, which include the principle that M?ori and the Crown should work in partnership, the principle that M?ori knowledge, interests, and values should be protected, and the principle of active participation of M?ori, including throughout Government and policy. However, the extent of these obligations and how they should manifest in today’s science, technology and innovation system remains unclear, including how to approach research which M?ori have a unique interest in, and how to integrate M?ori knowledge systems and values throughout the STI system. 

Current issues include research data management of M?ori data, including M?ori genomics data, which to M?ori is considered a taonga, or treasure. This data must be stored in New Zealand, if M?ori are to retain governance and ownership over it, however this creates tension with the increasing globalisation of the science system, and technological trends which include the use of offshore data storage centres. Similarly, M?tauranga M?ori, distinctive M?ori knowledge which has developed in M?ori communities for over 600 years, struggles to be recognised as complementary to western science systems, and there are ongoing debates around how this unique knowledge can be best promoted and reflected within New Zealand’s STI system, in a way that will encourage M?ori engagement and governance with the science system.","There are debates surrounding the balance between government support for basic and applied research, and the measures that should be used to determine what kind of research should be funded. There are arguments that it is more difficult to make a funding case for basic or ‘blue skies’ research due to it being harder to make out end-user benefits; despite this kind of research being critical for driving innovation through expanding the scientific knowledge base. However, New Zealand has a strong focus on research excellence as a criteria for funding, as well as a focus on funding research and innovation at the leading edge of what the world knows or can do - the other side of the argument is that excellent research, whether it is basic or applied, is supported from this angle, especially if it is cutting edge or world-leading.","There continues to be debate within New Zealand about how to raise levels of investment in R&D by the private sector. This will be critical if the Government is to make progress towards its target of increasing R&D expenditure as a whole to 2% of GDP by 2027. This was partly the rationale behind the introduction of a new R&D Tax Incentive which replaced a previous system of R&D Growth Grants. One option was to continue with administering grants (generally favoured by those firms already receiving these) – however the new policy was specifically designed with the aim of widening the reach of government support for firms doing R&D – whereas under the grant scheme around 300 New Zealand businesses were accessing support, under the Tax Incentive we envisage that 2000 – 3000 businesses could be eligible to claim the credit. 

The introduction of the tax incentive was underpinned by analysis that helped inform the debate by showing that businesses typically under invest in R&D because they cannot completely secure all of the benefits it brings, and therefore engagement by government can incentivise investment that might otherwise not happen – and by doing so we are able to capture a wider set of “spillovers” that benefit the wider economy as well as society more generally. 

The debate was also influenced by the fact that R&D tax incentives are a major tool for promoting business R&D globally, with most countries across the OECD operating them in some way. Because the tax system is accessed universally, we were able to put in place legislation that sets out transparent rules-based criteria to maximise certainty for businesses and encourage long-term planning. The debate has largely been settled following introduction of the new scheme from April 2019, however there has been some ongoing discussion about how to ensure there is equal treatment of firms conducting R&D some of which are profitable, and others which still remain pre-profit. The main policy considerations here are around how we balance the design of a scheme that permits maximum support to all businesses doing R&D, against a need to minimise opportunities for abuse which would damage the integrity of the tax system.",There are no current ongoing policy debates around science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing.,"The Government is committed to developing initiatives that will grow, support, attract and retain talent in New Zealand, but the form that these initiatives will take is yet to be decided. One of the points of debate is whether and how the Government should support postdocs. Postdocs are a common way for researchers to begin their career after earning their doctorate. Opportunities for postdoctoral fellowships in New Zealand are low and it is argued that if funding for postdocs is not increased, this may lead to New Zealand talent seeking opportunities internationally. However there are other ways to support talent in New Zealand, including by attracting talent from overseas. When designing and implementing new initiatives to support talent, finding the right balance between growing, supporting and retaining New Zealand talent, and attracting talent with unique skills from overseas, will be an ongoing issue.","There is an ongoing policy debate in New Zealand concerning gene editing, and whether our current regulations are still fit for purpose. Recent advances in gene editing technologies have the potential to help tackle societal challenges, including in healthcare, agriculture and conservation. Due to these potential benefits, there is an argument that New Zealand’s regulations should be reformed to give scientists greater flexibility and freedom in their use of gene editing technology. New Zealand’s current regulatory framework came into force in 1996, however, scientists today have a much deeper understanding of genetics and the potential benefits and risks associated with genetic technologies. Furthermore, the definitions contained in the current legislation, The Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act, date back to a time where genetically modified organisms were modified in vitro. However, these definitions are not reflective of modern advances in gene editing, as genetic modification technologies can today be applied to living organisms. On the other side of the debate, there are concerns that gene editing technologies have the potential to be unsafe, and could pose a biosecurity concern. Some consumers are wary of health risks which some claim are associated with genetically edited organisms,and some brands use “GE free” as a marketing point. There are also ethical issues surrounding the use of gene editing technologies, which New Zealand will have to work through in addressing any regulatory reform.",
Norway,"The government’s first long-term plan for research and higher education 2015–2024 was presented in 2014. The plan is revised every four years to accommodate changes in the political and societal landscape, and the first revision was made in 2018. The revised long-term plan still has a ten-year perspective (2019–2028), with a specification of goals and priority areas for the upcoming four-year period. The plan is one of the main tools for co-ordinating the government's research policy. The first long-term plan received some criticism for only having concrete funding targets in areas funded by the Ministry of Education and Research (infrastructure, PhD and postdoc. positions and European co-operation). For the upcoming period there are plans for escalation of efforts in the areas of technology and business R&D and innovation that also affects the budget lines of other ministries.

The government is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the agency structure and operations supporting business R&D and innovation, and considering, for example, the division of labour between different organisations and programmes, including the principal agencies Research Council of Norway and Innovation Norway.

The government has appointed a commission to review and propose changes to the regulations covering higher education, and has also announced that it will deliver a white paper (report to the Storting) on the steering of the public higher education institutions in connection with new legislation for higher education.

Following a change in the campus structure of one of the institutions that was merged in the higher education structure reform in 2016, there has been public debate around the university's autonomy in decisions regarding the geographical distribution of higher education. Some have called for the Minister of Higher Education and Research to intervene and overturn the decisions of the university, while others, including the rectors of the main higher education institutions, have voiced the need for the institutions themselves to make such decisions in accordance with their responsibility for the education provided.","Norwegian research institutes holds a unique position as both a provider and distributor of research to users. At the same time, policies for research institutes has over time been too complicated and poorly coordinated. Therefore, the Government has initiated a review of existing policies that also considers new measures for ensuring a more comprehensive research institute policy framework. For some time, there has been criticism that the government block funding of the technological research institutes has been too low, and lower than for comparable institutes in other countries. Increased block funding of the technological institutes was prioritised in the revised long-term plan research and higher education in 2018, and has been followed up in the national budget for both 2019 and 2020.

Cooperation with the EU in research and innovation is a core element in Norwegian research policy. The EU framework programme is our most important arena for international cooperation in research and innovation. Recently, the Norwegian government has declared its intention to participate in the next EU framework programme, Horizon Europe, which will entail a major investment and further increase the importance of this funding stream for public research institutions. 

Access to public sector information for research purposes has been a topic of some debate, with concerns raised by the research community that access to important register data is too time-consuming, costly and unpredictable, and that high quality health information is under-exploited due to unnecessary barriers for legitimate purposes such as research. The topic is an important part of the government’s national strategy on access to and sharing of research data from 2018. Since then there has been enacted a new law relating to official statistics and Statistics Norway, that continues the possibility of giving access to information collected by Statistics Norway to research purposes, and the government is considering ways to make the legitimate access of researchers more efficient. The portal Microdata.no makes it possible for a wider group of users in research, higher education and government to perform microdata analyses on register data, with automatic barriers that hinder the release of individual pieces of information. The government has also decided to a establish a Health Analysis Platform, that will enhance safe access to analyse health information for both research purposes, government planning and administration, and industry development, and strengthen the patients’ privacy and control of their own information.","The discussion on research and development intensity in Norway has changed over the last few years, as both total R&D expenditure and R&D intensity have increased strongly. The current government came into power in 2013 and has prioritised support to both public and private R&D. As a share of GDP, total R&D has increased from 1.65 % of GDP in 2013 to 2.09 % in 2017. A sizeable and sustained part of this growth has taken place in business R&D (from about 0.87 % of GDP in 2013 to 1.10 % in 2017).

Public support to business R&D has been increased. The approach has consisted of making the R&D tax-incentive (Skattefunn) more generous and increasing allocations to competitive R&D grants. R&D grants have been increased both through a broad, thematically neutral competitive programme and in areas of particular strategic interest for Norway. In addition, several measures to strengthen entrepreneurship policy has been implemented. 

Entrepreneurship policies and the investment fund approach have been strengthened. Following a green paper on access to capital in 2018 (The Capital Access Commission, Official Norwegian Report NOU 2018:5) and a public consultation process, a wide set of issues including entrepreneurship funding, SME financing and information problems, particularly using digital registers and meeting places have been raised. The government has suggested moving several existing tasks to fewer existing institutions while going forward with more seed capital measures. Among these, a green investment fund aimed at promising new businesses was launched early in 2019.

Several voices have argued that the number of schemes and actors has made the gate to the system complicated to pass. Against this backdrop, the government launched a comprehensive review of agency structure and support for business innovation in 2018. The review is aiming at increased user friendliness by defining roles and clearing up overlaps. At the same time, a more coherent setup between the local, regional, national and international level will be assessed, alongside an analysis of how to improve efficiency in administration and governance.","A white paper on labour market relevance in higher education will be put forward in early 2021. The transition from a resource-based economy to a more knowledge-based one, combined with technological development and increased globalisation, increase the demand for a highly qualified labour force. The white paper will concentrate on the cooperation between higher education and the labour market, focusing for instance on work based learning and how to strengthen innovation and entrepreneurial skills in higher education.

Following a green paper on access to capital in 2018 (The Capital Access Commission, NOU 2018:5), there has also been a raised awareness and a discussion on how to better ensure that results from publicly funded R&D may result in more economic growth. The Government has an ambition to strengthen the work on turning results from publicly funded research into products that reach the market, and measures on how to better ensure this are under discussion.

There has been public debate around policies for open access to publications, following the Research Council of Norway's participation in Plan S and requirement that funded articles should be published with open access from 2020. Critics argue that requirements for open access publishing hinder researchers from publishing in the most prestigious journals, with negative consequences for research quality. There has also been some debate regarding copyright and licensing issues, with claims that institutional requirements of open licensing conflict with the intellectual property rights of employees. The government has started a review of these questions.","Many issues regarding human resources in research are long-standing topics of discussion. Among these are questions related to the attractiveness of careers in academia (job insecurity and a high share of temporary positions), the availability of alternative career paths for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers and information about possible career paths. An expert group appointed by the Ministry of Education and Research delivered a report with proposals on changes in the career structure in higher education in 2018. The public hearing of the report did not support a change of the career structure, but alternatives to follow up on some of the issues are being considered by the ministry. Among these are questions on the use of temporary positions and how to better include experience from industry and working life in higher education. There is ongoing work on a government white paper on the labour market relevance of higher education.

Some issues raised in the debate are related to internationalisation, both regarding the balance between Norwegian and international staff members in universities, and how to support time-limited outward international mobility of staff. Diversity and gender equality (e.g. gender bias in quality assessments, low gender balance in higher-level positions) is another topic of debate concerning human resources and research quality.","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN member states in 2015 constitute an important part of the framework for the government’s long-term plan for research and higher education. Universities and university colleges have a major role to play in following up the sustainable development agenda through both education and research. In 2017, the University of Bergen launched “SDG Bergen”, a new mechanism for linking together the need for new knowledge for sustainable development with multidisciplinary research communities through science advice. The Research Council of Norway will prioritise sustainability in its funding of research and development, further develop instruments that target the sustainability challenges, and strengthen the sustainability perspective in international cooperation. 
Sustainable use of the ocean is a main priority for the Norwegian government. A revised ocean strategy, Blue opportunities, was presented in June 2019. The strategy underlines that a sound ocean policy and a sustainable ocean economy are vital for achieving the SDGs, and promotes an international framework for sustainable ocean management. The High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, led by Prime Minister Solberg, focusses on the protection of, production from, and investment in the ocean. The Panel will demonstrate how transitioning to a Sustainable Ocean Economy is critical to achieving the SDGs related to hunger, health, jobs, energy, sustainable communities and global partnerships.",
Peru,"This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The different sectors of the Peruvian Government are focusing their efforts on orienting the country’s research centres to respond to business-sector demand and improve their products to provide greater value added. The National Council for Science, Technology and Technological Innovation (CONCYTEC) and the Ministry of Production are currently working together to build an innovation agenda. The Ministry of Production is leading the National Plan for Production Diversification; one of its main goals is to implement a policy to foster business innovation. CONCYTEC leads the Create to Grow Strategy.

Moreover, the government is seeking to valuate Perus rich biodiversity; the agrarian sector is intent on integrating the use of precision agriculture; and the fishing sector received a boost through the creation of the National Programme for Innovation in Fisheries and Aquaculture (PNIPA) in 2017.

Under the Law of Canon or Royalties No. 27506, the regional governments will allocate 20% of the total distribution by canon to the public universities located in their circumscription, to be exclusively dedicated to investment in scientific and technological research promoting regional development. The important accumulation of royalty funds accumulated over previous years has driven several regional public universities. Public Sector Budget Law No. 30372 for 2016 (34th Final Complementary Provision) allows national government, regional government and local government entities to transfer resources to CONCYTEC. Based on Law No. 30372, CONCYTEC signed agreements with the National University of San Agustín de Arequipa (2016) and the National University San Antonio Abad of Cusco (2017) to develop science, technology and innovation (STI) in each university through funding and scholarship competitions.

The Congress of the Republic presented a bill to modify Framework Law No. 28303 on Science, Technology and Technological Innovation (STI) and Law No. 28613 on CONCYTEC, granting CONCYTEC a sanctioning role when ethics rules – e.g. on investigations, surrender of subsidies and plagiarism – are violated. This bill has received a technical opinion from CONCYTEC and is still under discussion.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

As the governing body of STI, CONCYTEC established the Registry of Researchers in Science and Technology (REGINA) in 2015 to qualify researchers who meet set requirements. In compliance with University Law No. 30220 (Article 86), the Ministry of Education has allocated part of the budget for 2017 and 2018 to paying a special bonus to public university instructors who fit the REGINA researcher category (a qualification granted by CONCYTEC).

There is no law in Peru that identifies and rewards paths for research careers. University Law No. 30220 only recognises the status of teacher-researcher, i.e. a university instructor who qualifies under the REGINA researcher criteria. The need to categorise researchers according to merit has therefore been identified. A law on research careers is being debated to assess the trajectory of STI researchers, mainly by highlighting the merits of their scientific and/or technological activities. The proposed law establishes categories for senior researchers, adjunct investigators, and young and postdoctoral researchers, all of which entail an economic bonus. CONCYTEC is working on modifying the REGINA regulation to categorise researchers’ careers along the same lines as investigators careers.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Peru is seeking to promote technological innovation. Competitive funds have been created to support entrepreneurship, business incubators and start-ups. Law No. 30309, adopted in 2015, grants tax benefits to companies that engage in STI activities, develop technologies and generate technological innovation, with the approval of CONCYTEC. The Law is being evaluated to determine whether the results have a macroeconomic impact in terms of generating innovation.

The Ministry of Production, through the National Programme of Innovation for Competitiveness and Productivity (Innovate Peru), and CONCYTEC (through CIENCIACTIVA) seek to increase business productivity by strengthening the capabilities of innovation actors (companies, entrepreneurs and support entities), and facilitating the relationships among them. Its specific objectives are to: 1) increase innovation in business-production processes; 2) promote innovative entrepreneurship; and 3) facilitate companies’ absorption and adaptation of technologies.

Mechanisms to strengthen the Network of Technological Innovation Centres (CITEs) are also being discussed. They include increasing the human resources of CITEs and establishing impact-analysis protocols that make it possible to specify the criteria for deciding the location and activities of CITEs, as identified in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization report (https://isid.unido.org/files/Peru/PCP_Peru_2016_Progress_Report.pdf).","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The Peruvian Government remains steadfast in its commitment to competitive funds. It promotes knowledge transfer through programmes such as Innovate Peru (Ministry of Production); CIENCIACTIVA (CONCYTEC); PNIPA (Ministry of Production); and the National Programme of Agrarian Innovation (Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation). CONCYTEC and the Ministry of Production are working together to intensify the links between government, academia and business. They are jointly organising a meeting between the leaders of companies and research centres, and public officers to reach a consensus on the country’s innovation mission.

The Ministry of Production’s Research and Development Fund for Competitiveness (FIDECOM), created in the context of its Innovate Peru initiative, is endowed with a budget of PEN 200 million (Peruvian soles). FIDECOM seeks to help increase the countrys competitiveness by financing research and development projects; capacity building; and knowledge transfer for productive innovation and business management.

In 2016, CONCYTEC approved the Special Programme for Technological Transfer, whose financial instruments are executed by CIENCIACTIVA. The Programme identified the factors preventing technology transfer from the research institutes, namely: insufficient linkages between research centres and the productive sector; low human capital specialising in technology transfer; a weak institutional framework for technology transfer; a weak innovation culture; and limited sources of financing for technology-transfer activities. The Programme seeks to generate the conditions for developing technology transfer in Peru by enhancing the linkages between research centres and the productive sector; generating the necessary human-resource capacities to ensure competent management of technology transfer; and promoting adequate mechanisms to ensure the institutional development of technology transfer, and the generation and promotion of the necessary capacities for exploiting research results.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Given that a number of university instructors do not possess a masters or doctoral (PhD) degree, the Ministry of Education, through University Law No. 30220, has determined that they must have at least a master’s degree to work as assistant teachers or associate teachers, and a PhD degree to work as principal instructors. Since 2017, the Ministry has granted a bonus to instructors who qualify as REGINA researchers.

In addition, CONCYTEC provides funding for public or private universities to create master’s or doctoral programmes in strategic areas, defined in the National STI Plan 2006-21, with the objective of training human resources for STI. CONCYTEC also offers funding for students undertaking doctoral degrees at foreign universities.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The National STI Plan 2006-21 was prepared jointly by various governments, academic and business entities. One of the Plan’s priority areas is the development of research and innovation for society. In 2016, the Plan introduced the National Transversal Programme for Environmental Science and Technology.

The National Institute of Health – a public organisation under the Ministry of Health with technical autonomy and economic, financial and administrative management – is primarily responsible for promoting, developing and disseminating scientific research on all national health issues.

The coastal El Niño phenomenon, which caused disasters and floods in different Peruvian cities in 2017, led the Peruvian Government to consider innovation from a more social perspective. To motivate society to participate actively in social innovation and promote a culture of prevention, the Ministry of Production, through Innovate Peru, created the “Resilient Peru” challenge, which allows co-financing projects at any of the three stages – preparation, reaction and recovery – in the integral management of social-disaster risk caused by natural phenomena. The contest is open to proposals from innovative companies and supports the validation and implementation pilot programmes.",
Poland,"Innovation policy in Poland in recent years has been undergoing many changes. Insufficient progress has been observed in the performance of the innovation system and on the economy as a whole. Thus, Poland is shifting its innovation policy to avoid falling into the “middle-income country trap” and become competitive in high-value added markets. The challenge is to increase the share of the high-technology sector in the economy. In particular, the adaptation of innovative solutions to the country’s exported products and services that are sought in world markets. 

Polish innovation is currently characterised by (i) innovation by creative imitation; and, (ii) poor cooperation between actors and innovators. The challenge of changing the model of innovation beyond creative imitation is a main point of debate. The most important barriers to the development of innovation of Polish companies are risk-aversion and a low motivation to invest in innovation and training. In addition, the innovation support system has two main weaknesses: (i) the mismatch between available instruments and target groups’ needs; and, (ii) an excessive share of non-refundable assistance.

In terms of funding, the existing Polish innovation system is largely based on European Union allocations. This has resulted in a reliance on the priorities set by the European Commission, while also transferring regulations and management methods for the funds acquired. Discussions on the causes of Poland’s persisting lag and the effectiveness of the EC’s approach to promoting innovation are ongoing. A comprehensive legislative reform programme has already been undertaken to improve this situation. The innovation support system in the new financial perspectives of the European Union (Horizon Europe) is also being modified.","In 2018, the “Constitution for Science”, also known as the “Law 2.0”, entered into force as a comprehensive reform of the Polish higher education and science system. In principle, the reform aims to (i) give higher education institutes (HEIs) more autonomy; (ii) increase the impact of research performed in Polish institutions on world science; and, (iii) improve the quality of education, including doctoral training. Its adoption was preceded by a long process of dialogue with stakeholders. A process of pre-consultation started in early 2016 and finished in September 2017 with a first draft proposal. The pre-consultation included nine conferences, termed the “National Congress of Science"", and concluded with the presentation of the proposal. Approximately 7 000 scientists, students and experts took part in this phase. The process was followed by regular public consultations which lasted four months. The new law on higher education and science as well as the act on implementation of the law were adopted in July 2018 and entered into force on 1 October 2018. The full names of these two acts are: the Act of 20 July 2018 Law on Science and Higher Education and the Act of 3 July 2018 on the Implementation of the Law on Higher Education and Science.

The reform addresses, among other things, the following issues:
-	Enhancing the autonomy of HEIs, including financial autonomy; 
-	Raising the visibility of public research outcomes; 
-	Improving the quality and relevance of study programmes provided by HEIs; 
-	Improving the efficiency of doctoral training;
-	Diversifying the public research system's internal structure; and,
-	Reviewing the system of academic degrees and conferred titles. 

The implementation of the reform opened a room for discussion on these objectives and, at a broader level, the governance and structure of HEIs. In 2019, the initiative named ""The National Congress of Science - Forum” was set up as a follow-up to the pre-consultation conferences. These fora serve as stakeholders' platform for exchanging opinions on and experiences from implementation of the Law 2.0 at an institutional level.","In recent years, many public instruments have been set up in Poland to support companies introducing innovations. Enterprises can obtain grants for R&D expenditures and for implementing the results of these investments. Grants with the highest budgets, mainly EU co-financed support programs, offer grants through an open competition to all companies meeting established criteria. There are also sectoral programs dedicated to companies from industries with the highest growth potential (representing national smart specialisations). A large start-up support program called “Start in Poland” includes various types of venture capital funds and accelerators that offer support for the development of young innovative companies. The introduction of tax reliefs for companies conducting R&D and the so-called IP Box (preferential tax rate for income from intellectual property rights) proved to be an attractive incentive for enterprises. The number of enterprises profiting from these tax reliefs is increasing every year.

Apart from different forms of financial support, public agencies and business support institutions provide trainings and advisory services to innovative companies. In this context it is worth noting that a new public foundation, the Industry of the Future Platform, has been established to support Polish enterprises in the digital transformation towards industry 4.0.

As a result of these sorts of support, together with stable economic growth, business expenditure in R&D (BERD) is steadily growing, reaching 66% of GERD in 2018. However, increasing the number of enterprises conducting R&D and implementing innovative solutions remains a challenge. While small companies dominate the Polish economy, they are characterised by low productivity level and low propensity to implement innovations. Moreover, the poor quality of cooperation between the business sector and the science sector also remains a problem. Inventions arising at universities and research institutes are rarely commercialised. Investment funds have difficulties finding young innovative companies or research teams that may become the object of investment.

Taking into account the above conditions, the public debate on support for innovative companies currently focuses on the following topics:
-	Increasing the number of enterprises introducing innovations;
-	Encouraging enterprises to increase their use of the public research system and strengthening cooperation between the science and industry;
-	Simplifying existing support instruments to make them more attractive to companies;
-	Determining the level (national or regional) whereby support for innovative companies is more effective;
-	Determining the type of support for enterprises that is more effective (e.g. horizontal tax reliefs, grants or support through investment funds);
-	Preparing enterprises for the challenges related to the digital revolution and climate change;
-	Having the state or public bodies address emerging social challenges through the coordination and implementation of innovative solutions.","In 2018, the “Constitution for Science”, also known as the “Law 2.0”, entered into force as a comprehensive reform of the Polish higher education and science system. Its adoption was preceded by a long process of dialogue among representatives of the government, science and the economy. The Ministry of Sciences and Higher Education led a lively dialogue and discussion with the communities of scientists and entrepreneurs, which resulted in the publication of the White Paper on innovation, which resulted in four new laws promoting innovation and science-industry knowledge transfer. These have recently entered into force and we can observe the first effects of their actions:

-	The so-called “First Innovation Act” (Ustawa z dnia 4 listopada 2016 r. o zmianie niektórych ustaw okre?laj?cych warunki prowadzenia dzia?alno?ci innowacyjnej (Dz.U., poz. 1933);

-	On the basis of the experience gained from this act, its amendment, called the “Second Innovation Act”: (Ustawa z dnia 9 listopada 2017 r. o zmianie niektórych ustaw w celu poprawy otoczenia prawnego dzia?alno?ci innowacyjnej (Dz.U. 2017 poz. 2201)

-	The Law on the ?ukasiewicz Research Network (ustawa o Sieci Badawczej ?ukasiewicz Dz.U. z 2019 r. poz. 534);

-	The law on supporting the scientific activities of the Polish Science Fund (ustawa z dnia 4 kwietnia 2019 r. o wspieraniu dzia?alno?ci naukowej z Funduszu Polskiej Nauki Dz.U. z 2019 poz. 823).","In 2018, the “Constitution for Science”, also known as the “Law 2.0”, entered into force as a comprehensive reform of the Polish higher education and science system. The reform was preceded by a series of conferences taking place during 2016-17, termed ""The National Congress of Science” as the major means of public consultation. A few of the conferences addressed directly issues related to development of human resources for research and innovation, the quality of doctoral training and the diversification of academic teachers’ career paths. 

The discussion on these matters is being continued within the framework of “The National Congress of Science – Forum”, that is, a series of conferences serving as stakeholders' platform for exchanging opinion on and experiences from implementation of the Law 2.0 at an institutional level. Human resources and career paths in the higher education system were the main subject of one of those conferences in 2019.","Sustainable development is considered to be a fundamental right in the provisions of Poland’s Constitution, as stated in Article 5 of the Basic Act: “The Republic of Poland shall safeguard the independence and integrity of its territory and […] ensure the protection of the natural environment pursuant to the principles of sustainable development.”

The Polish perspective on actions regarding sustainable and responsible economic development has been formulated in the 2030 Strategy for Responsible Development (SRD), adopted on 14 February 2017. The strategy is an instrument for flexible management of the major national development processes. It sets out over 700 actions to increase the income of Polish citizens and strengthen social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion within the country. 

The SRD presents a new responsible model of development, i.e. one that, in the process of strengthening competitiveness by exploring new means of economic growth, allows the participation of and provides benefits to all social groups living in various parts of the country. The main objective of all actions and projects set out in the strategy is to create conditions that foster income growth for all residents of Poland, while also increasing social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion. Its implementation is expected to increase the wealth of the Polish people and decrease the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion. At the same time, within the new model, the needs of the present generation will be fulfilled without reducing the opportunities of future generations. The focus is not solely on the total size of GDP, but rather on its quality as well as the perception of the development processes in the context of their importance to citizens.

In addition, the concept of sustainable and responsible development, on which the strategy was built, is consistent with the ambitious vision of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development Goals, i.e. a vision of a world free of poverty, where every human being has the opportunity to benefit from development. The convergence of the Strategy and the 2030 Agenda is noticeable in their shared objectives, priority areas, actions and indicators. The coordinator for the implementation process of the SRD and of the UN 2030 Agenda at the government level in Poland is the Ministry of Economic Development.",
Portugal,"The governance of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is one of the main challenges and opportunities for policy making to: (i) better integrate education, research and innovation activities of higher education institutions (HEIs) and research institutions (RIs); (ii) foster greater synergies and impacts from investments in education and research at local and global levels; and, (iii) strengthen institutional and international relational frameworks.

The 2019 OECD review of the Portuguese Research Innovation and Higher Education System has promoted national debates on the interaction of different actors and the educational, social, scientific and their economic impact. These debates have also been followed by policy developments and new legislation, under a consolidation path. Recent policy initiatives and legislation can be identified, namely the so called “Law of Science”, which can be framed in five fundamental pillars: 
(i) The institutional context of the scientific and technological system, as regards scope, organisation, diversification and linkage to the territory, emphasizing the distinctive role of State Laboratories, Associate Laboratories, Collaborative Laboratories and R&D units, including public and private research organisations; 
(ii) The human capital, concerning the training of advanced human resources and the promotion of researchers careers and working conditions; 
(iii) The social, cultural, institutional and scientific responsibility of R&D activities and promotion of scientific and technological culture; 
(iv) The internationalization of the national research system, and the compelling need to broaden international scientific and technological cooperation, the participation in international organizations, and the advanced training of Portuguese speaking scientists; and 
(v) The assessment, funding and monitoring the national scientific and technological system.
This recent revision of the legal framework for the coordination of the National Research and Innovation System entities stems from an open public debate and stands out as rather significant contribution to the improvement of the governance process. 

In institutional terms, this clarification adds to substantiate the creation of consortia as a principle, calling for more private funding translating into new forms of risk-sharing partnerships among government, industry and academia, skilled employment and wealth creation oriented. This approach is leading to stronger optimization of resources and impacts, inspiring the surge of relevant CoLabs, and giving rise to new initiatives in critical and emerging areas, such as (i) the Atlantic International Research (AIR) Centre, in the form of an intergovernmental organization through a public-private partnership with a flexible international governance model, together with a Space R&I Agenda (i.e. “Portugal Space 2030”) including new technology business for “New Space”; (ii) the “Portuguese Space Agency”, with a flexible public-private partnership and governance model, and (iii) the “Clinical Research and Biomedical Innovation Agency” involving a flexible public-private partnership and governance model, providing financial contributions to the promotion of clinical research and new technology business.","The Portuguese Government’s financial support to the public research system has been following a consolidation path after severe disruptions felt during the financial crisis years. GBARD, and consequently, GERD, have yet to recover to pre-2012 levels, although recent years have seen an increase in public and private investment. The structural consequences of the financial crisis years in the public research system, which created difficulties in scientific infrastructures, equipment and, most relevantly, personnel, were partially compensated by the structurally competitive funding mechanism of the research institutions. By design, since the 1990’s, the percentage of competitive funding against block funding in the Portuguese public research institutions is higher than in most European Union Member Countries. In the context of the financial crisis, the experience of Portuguese R&D institutions in capturing competitive funding enabled them to partially compensate for the reduction of government funding and for funding policies that hindered the development of the research system as a whole (which tended to concentrate funding only in the institutions deemed as excellent).

Given the competitive nature of funding in the Portuguese public research system, new government-led policy initiatives often generate debate among the main actors of the system, namely the universities and research institutions, on how that new initiative should be financially supported. A relevant, recent example of this was the new scientific employment legal framework, which reinforced the researcher’s careers and their working conditions. This new legal framework, improving the employment conditions of non-permanent researchers, led to an increase in the cost of research personnel. There was also a strong debate between government and universities, involving Parliament, on who should support the increased costs: the Government, by increasing the block funding attributed to the research institutions, or the institutions themselves, by factoring in the new cost structure into the competitive funding they are able to capture.

Besides the Government funding support, other measures have tried to improve the functioning of the public research system. In 2018, a new legal diploma (DL 60/2018) simplified the administrative procedures related to contracts and acquisitions, an exception to the general regulations created specifically for the research institutions. This diploma was framed in a broader, state-wide simplification initiative (SIMPLEX+), which includes areas dedicated to the research system: the Programme “More Science, less bureaucracy” (https://www.maiscienciamenosburocracia.com/) aggregates those measures, which include, for example, simplified procedures for foreign researchers, or a Science ID which identifies a researcher through all the services of public administration.","The main debates regarding business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship are still focused on (i) the promotion of innovation as a factor of economic competitiveness and internationalization of Portuguese companies, valuing knowledge-based investment, attracting high tech foreign direct investment (FDI) and promoting qualified employment and entrepreneurship; (ii) the digital transformation and the challenges for the Portuguese companies, and (iii) the promotion of an environment supporting creative and knowledge-based entrepreneurship.

Core concerns regarding entrepreneurship and internationalization include the creation of new enterprises with innovation potential and value added, triggering high quality employment and closer links to investment promoters, early detection of projects and enterprises, as well as access to emergent markets and stronger capture of high tech related FDI (i.e. “Programme Internacionalizar”). The 2018-2030 Technological and Business Innovation Strategy for Portugal further substantiates this debate, complementing the Start-Up Portugal Strategy and Industry 4.0. The Interface Program has also addressed the capacitation of national enterprises for international and national higher profiles. In this area, Portugal Ventures, a public-private initiative, has a pivotal role in providing risk capital, and even in promoting the involvement of other business angels.

Sustainable employment has been addressed in several perspectives: at the entrepreneurial level in the STARTUP Portugal Strategy, emphasising training for entrepreneurs; at the scientific level the Programme for Scientific Employment, which was extensively debated in the Parliament; and, at a professional level, initiatives such as Professional Technical Higher Courses (TESPs) and “Young Technicians for Industry”, aiming at “innovation readiness”, i.e. attracting and keeping talents in the system at an overall critical mass for a quicker absorption of new technologies and innovations. Also worth highlighting are the active creation of Collaborative Laboratories (CoLABS) and the Programme for Technology Interface Centre (CIT´s), both intermediary institutions benefitting from specific support to recruit highly qualified human resources.
Concerning the digital transition, Phase II of Industry i4.0 was broadly discussed, focusing on accelerating the adoption of this agenda by the business fabric, promoting national technological suppliers as i4.0 players, and turning Portugal into an attractive pole for i4.0 investment. CAPACITAR is a programme led by the Ministry of Economy that encompasses the national activities Industry 4.0 (i.4.0) and INCODE 4.0 (for digital competences), which aim at qualifying people and organisations for the challenges of 4th industrial revolution. As part of the CAPACITAR Programme, the Portugal INCoDe.2030 aims to bridge the digital gap and to stimulate employability.

Capacity building as a driver for Public Procurement, leading to quality investment was broadly discussed in national and international conferences involving all relevant stakeholders including entrepreneurs, policy makers, legislators, universities, researchers and central, regional and local administration bodies, among others. The impact on innovation of the recently issued Code for (DL 111-B/2017, 31 August) gathered attention in particular. The investment in Portugal by different large technology-based multinationals involving recruitment of highly qualified human resources, provide examples of quality and innovative investment. 
The annual Initiative Web Summit promotes interactions within the national and international research and innovation ecosystem, inspiring new entrepreneurs and foreign investors, and leading to business innovation and firms internationalization towards digital transition.","Ongoing debates are focusing on the need for a further densification of intermediate links within the innovation cycle, i.e. where the processes of knowledge transfer and valorisation critically take place among public research, private companies and society. Important debates have occurred namely as part of the definition of the Strategy Portugal 2030. These targets are at the core of the Interface Program, ensuring the development of scientific knowledge for different business segments, mobilizing and raising awareness of actors for research and innovation impact, streamlining technological services, and supporting entrepreneurial qualification in order to enter international value chains. 
Fully taking advantage of the available excellence in research and innovation is crucial to address new challenges, develop new business and scientific areas and adopt new technologies for the circular economy, energy efficiency and industry 4.0 processes. In the remit of the National Agency for Innovation (ANI) the Accelerating Programme Born from Knowledge (BfK Rise) was launched to enable knowledge/technology transfer to the economic fabric and to society, with initial mentorship support at the regional level. Also, the new Innovation Platform is targeting better efficiency among all actors of the value chain by acting as a search engine for the R&I outcomes produced by the actors of the National Innovation Ecosystem, and visualising their competence profiles and activities. Also pertinent is the Programme for the Modernisation and Valorisation of Polytechnic Institutes, which further reinforces practice-based R&D activity oriented towards professional development, enabling local solutions.
Other initiatives aiming to leverage research and innovation excellence include the updating of the National RoadMap of Research Infrastructures of Strategic Interest, with up to 12 new infrastructures for innovation and collaboration with academia and impact in knowledge transfer. These infrastructures tackle several scientific fields including cancer, environment (the AIR Atlantic Centre), advanced computing, food chain alliance, precision agriculture, water management, advanced systems of agro-industrial processing, circular economy, spatial infrastructures, advanced electronic microscopy for health and life Sciences, high enthalpy flows, ageing and biobanks . This process led to the establishment of the Portuguese Space Agency (PT Space). On international grounds, the role of national collaborations with ESA, namely the Portuguese participation in mandatory and optional programs, has led to an important process of knowledge transfer. Contributions to knowledge transfer from other initiatives are worth mentioning, in particular the recent launching of the PERIN network (Portugal – Europe Research and Innovation Network), which strives for the promotion of successful participation in the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation (H2020 and Horizon Europe). The network also promotes digital transformation and the effective insertion of Portuguese policies in the European context following a convergence strategy for the “Europe of Knowledge by 2030"", easing the implementation of the “Innovation Strategy for Portugal 2018-2030"". This includes liaison elements for R&D activities that foster partnerships between public research actors and international organisations to promote European Programmes. Also, the initiative goPORTUGAL 2018-2030 has recently expanded the scope of international partnerships, namely with US Universities (now being expanded with the UK), stimulating scientific and economic development, creating value and new services, products and processes. These partnerships aim to attract qualified human resources to Portugal, create qualified employment, stimulate interactions between research and companies and the economic fabric, and broadening the UTEN (University Technology Enterprise Network).","The main ongoing policy debates are centred on raising skills, the promotion of qualified employment and on the ageing of the Portuguese society. The government has been investing and recommending the enhancement of training in areas relevant to science, technology and digital skills. Measures to maximize the absorption of qualified human resources by the business sector and to tackle the aging of university staff have also been implemented.

An important goal for social cohesion is widening of the access to higher education and to science and technology activities. This, namely by encouraging student attendance to public higher education in regions of the country with lower demand and less demographic pressure by reinforcing practice-based R&D activities oriented towards professional development and by encouraging short-term study programmes. Policy has also sought to increase support for the qualification of advanced human resources. Specific areas include reinforcing funding for PhD fellowships (with the objective of improving convergence with the European Union) and strengthening tertiary education to increase the overall qualifications of the workforce and to ensure the contribution of young scientists in science, technology and innovation (STI) debates.
With the aim of strengthening the human resource base of the science and technology system, and in parallel with an extensive debate in the national parliament and in the public sphere, a new legal framework was published in 2016 to stimulate scientific employment and decrease precariousness for researchers at postdoctoral level. The framework aims to encourage institutional co-responsibility by pooling public funding together with institutional initiatives (universities and research institutes) and to retain and attract talents, guaranteeing open standards in their recruitment. It is recognized in international studies published in recent years that Portugal is one of the European countries where brain drain is more accentuated. Such studies point to factors perceived as crucial in the decision to migrate, such as the economic crisis, the devaluation of local resources, the lack of career opportunities and unemployment. The new legal framework aims to address this challenge by promoting the wider conditions of scientific employment in view of stimulating internal mobility, fostering the attractiveness of the national research system.

Specific support for the hiring of PhDs was not significantly capitalised by the Portuguese economic sector in the past. In this sense, the valorisation and recruitment of highly qualified human resources (including doctorates) is part of the strategy for fostering the collaboration between the research and business sectors. In addition, improving intermediation mechanisms and institutions is an important measure to encourage the collaboration of skilled employment with the productive, social and cultural actors. An example initiative is the creation of Collaborative Laboratories, which are characterised by orienting public support towards human resources. Another indirect policy supporting human resources for STI is the R&D tax credits policy, which has specific provisions promoting the employment of doctorate holders in businesses. Other policies are aimed at attracting foreign direct investment in research and innovation, with a consequent impact in the employment of qualified human resources, namely through visa policies.

Regarding investment in the development of required skills and resources for a knowledge society and economy, it is worth highlighting the promotion of productivity gains in the business sector by raising digital skills in human resources. The InCoDE initiative has been an important instrument in this regard. At the basic education level, scientific and technological knowledge is a major area of competence contemplated by decision makers and educational actors, and science communication in schools has been particularly fostered in the past two years.","Current public research and innovation policy debates on societal wellbeing and cohesion are following mainstream discussions in the Portuguese society, notably debates on the difference of innovation potential and performances across regions, reflecting imbalances in education, training, skills and the knowledge production capacity. In this context, ideas and proposals advocate the articulation between policy instruments and the collaboration among political agents to address key challenging issues:
-	Promoting local and regional scientific knowledge bases and research and innovative potential; empowering Polytechnic Institutes, necessarily in close conjunction with the local economic, social or artistic sectors; supporting the creation and promotion of applied studies (Modernisation and Valuing Polytechnic Institutes programme).
-	Promoting digital competences as a critical factor, including a fast-paced adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and other digital related technologies and competences throughout society and the economy (see National Initiative for Digital Skills e.2030 - Portugal INCoDe.2030).
-	Promoting interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary R&D activities in specific territories. 

Regarding the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Portugal advocated during the preparation of the 2030 Agenda the sharing of responsibilities between public and private actors and between developed and developing countries, emphasizing the importance of development articulated between these different actors. These principles of collaboration are the basis for Portugal to incorporate SDGs in the design and implementation of science, technology and innovation policy. There are initiatives that, even if not exclusively dedicated to SDGs, are designed to strongly contribute to their attainment. These include the Scientific Employment Stimulus 2017/2018, the Atlantic International Research Centre, and Thematic Research and Innovation Agendas. There are other initiatives that are not designed to have direct impact in SDGs, but should provide contributions to these goals, including Portugal Space 2030 (a Research, Innovation and Growth Strategy for Portugal), the Knowledge for Development Initiative and the Port Tech Cluster Lisbon (an innovation and blue start-ups accelerator located in the Port of Lisbon).

A key initiative that is fostering an intense debate around societal challenges is the “Thematic Research and Innovation Agendas” initiative. It promotes the dialogue between scientific and business communities, combining the capacities and needs of researchers, citizens, business, public administration and civil society organizations. It aims to create a medium- and long-term vision of the Portuguese research and innovation system and define the approaches for achieving this vision in each of the thematic areas considered. These are: agri-food, forestry and biodiversity; climate change; Portuguese architecture; urban science and cities for the future; culture and cultural Heritage; the circular economy; space and earth observation; social inclusion and citizenship; industry and manufacturing; oceans; health, clinical and translational research; cyber-physical systems and advanced forms of computation and communication; sustainable energy systems; labour, automation and job qualification in Portugal; and tourism, leisure and hospitality.",
Romania,"Current debates focus on: (i) R&D intensity (GERD is currently accounting for 0.51 % GDP); and, (ii) shifting decision-making from the national to regional level (NUTS2). Each region has a Regional Development Agency (RDA) that elaborates a Regional Development Plan ensuring the technical management of funding. A proper regionalization process, however, remains uncertain in Romania. The topic has been intermittently on the top of the public policy agenda, but controversies regarding the appropriate depth and breadth of regionalization have determined the delay of any firm decision. To date, neither of the two types of regions (NUTS1 and NUTS2) have a legal status, and both exist primarily for the purpose of coordinating development projects.

Besides the region of Bucharest-Ilfov, the other seven completed in 2017 the design of Smart Specialization Strategies, responding to the European Commission’s requirement for regions within European Union Member States to receive funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Romania’s regional strategies constitute inputs to the ongoing process of developing a national R&D and innovation strategy. To coordinate the regional and the national policies, in August 2019 a National Committee for Coordination of the Smart Specialisation Strategies was established. It includes members from various ministries such as the Ministry of Research and Innovation, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of National Education, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Communications and the Information Society. 

At the end of 2019, the Ministry of Research and Innovation was merged with the Ministry of National Education to form the Ministry of Education and Research (MER). A share of around 90% of the total R&D budget is coordinated by MER. The remaining part is coordinated by the Romanian Academy while less than 1% is the responsibility of sectoral ministries. 

MER collaborates with two advisory bodies on RD&I: i/ the Advisory Board for RD&I, composed of scientific and business community representatives and supporting the promotion of applied research and innovation, and ii/ the National Council for Scientific Research composed of scientific community representatives and supporting the promotion of fundamental research and the development of human resources for research. Both RD&I advisory bodies have important responsibilities in assisting the MER to shape its policy and to design and evaluate the implementing instruments.","The RD&I system in Romania consists of 263 public R&D organisations (56 public universities, 46 national R&D institutes, 65 research institutes and centres of the Romanian Academy, and another 96 public research institutes and centres), and about 600 private companies declaring R&D. The network for technology transfer and innovation (ReNITT) has around 50 specific organizations (technology transfer centres, technology information centres, technology and business incubators). The number of R&D personnel in the public sector was approx. 31,500 in 2018. The percentage of researchers per 1000 civil employed persons was 2.02 (2017, https://data.oecd.org/rd/researchers.htm). General remarks are (i) the public system is too fragmented with respect to the available funding, and (ii) low administrative capacity. The financing agencies Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation (UEFISCDI), Romanian Space Agency (ROSA) and Institute for Atomic Physics (IFA) are managing the implementation of the National RD&I Plan. 

The assessment of the implementation of RD&I programmes is carried out by independent entities. Ongoing discussions highlight that actual national policies have to tackle some challenges: (i) not enough agreement among short-term results, budget cycles, and long-term strategies, which should transcend the electoral cycle; (ii) the existence of too many strategies suffering from overlaps and discrepancies between design and implementation; (iii) significant degree of fragmentation of the public system, lack of coordination and communication; and (iv) insufficient and unpredictable financing, which means that not all the planned financing instruments come into force.","Debates primarily focus on regional-national smart specialization strategic visions, involving Romania’s eight regions and the relevant ministries. Discussions have focused mainly on finding sectors with strong potential for smart specialization potential. A preliminary list includes: creative industries, Information and Communication Technologies, bio-economy / biotechnologies, pharma, automotive, naval Industry, metallurgy, electronics). Another theme concerns the factors that hinder innovation, including (i) public funding for R&D and for innovation based on R&D, (ii) education and human resources (scientific and entrepreneurial), (iii) legal and fiscal framework, and (iv) collaboration for R&D and innovation and technology transfer. 

Structural deficiencies in markets have been identified with large gaps in competitiveness and technological readiness of local companies compared to the main EU competitors in most sectors, especially in agriculture. The lack of an adequate transport infrastructure affects the automotive sector. Stakeholders consider this the most serious handicap of the Romanian industry in terms of competitiveness on the European market. In addition to the transport infrastructure, another major bottleneck is the lack of a clear vision for the country’s economic development.","Debates have been provoked by the country profiles revealed by the European Innovation Scoreboard and the 2018 Progress Report for the European Research Area. 
Deeper insights have been identified in the OECD report on entrepreneurship and innovation (available at https://heinnovate.eu/sites/default/files/oecd_ec_supporting_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_higher_education_in_romania.pdf), in the Romanian Academy study ""Increasing the administrative capacity of the Ministry for Business, Trade and Entrepreneurship to implement the evidence-based public policy”, as well as in the annex „Analysis of factors that obstruct the diffusion of innovation, including digitization”. 
Under constraints of resource scarcity, opinions are divided regarding objective criteria to determine the appropriate share of budget allocation for experimental development against fundamental research. Pro arguments for the first rely on the expectations of quantifiable economic benefits, in line with the financing philosophy of a large part of European programmes, like Horizon Europe. A super deduction of 150% of RD expenses is in force for companies investing in applied research and experimental development (tax relief through a volume based RD tax allowance at an additional rate of 50%). This is not fully agreed by the research centres located in the Magurele area (e.g. Extreme Light Infrastructure) which consider fundamental research as a viable option. 
Another debate is on university research vs. national RD institutes: the latter do not behave as sources of knowledge / technology for the industrial sectors they serve.","A downward trend in student population started in the 2009-10 academic year. Causes included a decreasing number of high school graduates passing the baccalaureate exam and the reduction in years of study (i.e. the effects of the Bologna process implementation started showing after 2008-09). Other possible causes leading to this drastic decrease are the high early-leaving rate in the pre-university education system and the phenomenon of external migration, which affects the size of the cohort that can reach this educational level. Many programmes in private universities have closed down. While in the 2010-11 academic year there were +870 000 students enrolled in public and private higher education institutes (HEIs), the figures dropped to +530 000 students in 2016-17. Of the total number of students enrolled in higher education in this year, only 3.6% were in doctoral programmes and 0.6% in postgraduate programmes. 

In the last academic years, the distribution of students by specialisation shows higher weights in certain areas. In 2016-17, 23.7% of undergraduate students were enrolled in business, administration and law; 21.1% in engineering, processing and construction; and 16% in the health and social assistance group. The lowest numbers are recorded in the following fields: education sciences (3.1%), services (3.7%), and natural sciences, mathematics and statistics (4.1%). The last group is critical for R&D capacity and therefore for the development of technology- and knowledge-intensive sectors. 

To tackle the challenges, a tax exemption on salary incomes for the personnel involved in CD activities came into force since 2016. The exemption is granted for all persons included in the team of an RD&I project within the limits for personnel costs.","The Romanian Academy (RoA), as member of All European Academies, gives particular attention to open science initiatives such as Science Europe’s Plan S. The RoA considers that effective policies on open access to scientific information require a shared international approval. At a national and institutional level, policies on non-discriminatory, democratic and free access to scientific information should be implemented. Scientific communication can be achieved only by approving new models that remove barriers to information sharing.",
Russian Federation,"Current debates in STI policy are focused around national development goals stated in the Russian President's Decree No. 204 dated May 7, 2018 ""On the National Development Goals and Strategic Objectives of the Russian Federation in the Period until 2024"". Two national goals out of nine to be achieved by 2024 refer to ""acceleration of the technological development of the Russian Federation, an increase in the number of organizations implementing technological innovations, up to 50 percent of their total number"" and ""ensuring accelerated implementation of digital technologies in the economy and social sphere"". 

To achieve these national goals in STI and digitalization, the national project ""Science"" and the national programme ""Digital Economy"" have been adopted by the President's Council on Strategic Development and National Projects in 2018. The activities within these two programmes will be one of the major focuses in STI policy in the coming years.","The ongoing debates around the public research system primarily refer to the implementation of the national project ""Science"" and its new tools – establishment of world-class research and educational centers in the regions, update of research equipment, and launch of complex S&T programmes within the S&T priorities of the Russian Federation. The adoption of the new law ""On scientific, scientific and technological, and innovation activities in the Russian Federation"" is another important issue being discussed within the government, the parliament and the expert community.

Compared to the previous period of the 2010s, when the role of universities in research and innovation was particularly emphasized, now the Russian Academy of Sciences is trying to reestablish itself as a leading expert centre taking an active part in formulating and evaluating science policy, as well as in assessing basic research results nationwide.","The major national goal has been set within the President's Decree of 7 May 2018 No 204 to accelerate technology development of the Russian economy and to increase the share of enterprises engaged in technological innovation up to 50%. Key policy initiatives in this domain include the National Technology Initiative aimed at opening new innovative markets, the new National Project ""Labour Productivity and Employment Support"", which provides indirect support of organisational and technological innovations at industrial enterprises, and the National Programme ""Digital Economy"". The latter provides a number of new grants and subsidies to support innovative SMEs within the IT sector.

The President’s Decree has given new impetus to several ongoing activities. In particular, the Foundation for Assistance to Small Innovative Enterprises has scaled up support for projects aimed at commercializing scientific results, as well as for projects commissioned by an industrial partner. The Internet Initiatives Development Fund has stepped up its efforts to accelerate high-tech business and attract seed investment.","Ways to increase the effectiveness of academic-industry collaboration remains on the Russian STI policy agenda. One of the new government initiatives is the establishment of world-class scientific and educational centres in the regions. The centres are created in the form of consortia of R&D organisations, universities, and business enterprises, which are supported by regional authorities. Their main goals are to streamline technology transfer and increase sales of innovative and high-tech products.
Another policy direction concerns support to the digital transformation of Russian industrial enterprises, as well as development and transfer of general purpose technologies in the sectors of the national economy. Particular policy tools in the form of grants and low-interest loans are under development.","The development of human capital for science, technology and innovation has been one of the major focuses in the last years. It has been included in the S&T Strategy of Russia. Increasing the attractiveness of work in Russia for leading scientists and young promising researchers is one of the national goals approved by the President of the Russian Federation. A number of new research grants were introduced within the National Project ""Science"" to support research projects implemented by PhD students and young scientists, as well as to facilitate academic mobility within Russian regions. Another policy initiative aimed at improving management skills of Russian scientists concerns the establishment of centres for training of managers of research projects and research laboratories in the regions.

Other tools to promote the development of human resources for science are also being discussed. These include initiatives to create “mirror” university laboratories in the regions aimed at exchanging experience between leading and “catching up” universities, as well as proposals to increase salaries for highly qualified scientists who are in demand on the international labour market. Reorganising the system of postgraduate education in Russia with the improvement of training of academic personnel in postgraduate courses has been another important focus of national research policy.","The Strategy for S&T Development of Russia, which was adopted by the President in December 2016, defines the grand challenges for Russia: decreasing opportunities of economic growth based on exploitation of primary resources; ageing of population, and new social and healthcare problems; food security and food independence; increase in importance of energy supply; external security threats; and the necessity of effective exploration of territory. 

The Strategy should meet these grand challenges through the implementation of R&D and innovation projects and programmes within the S&T priorities of Russia. For example, the recently adopted Federal S&T programme for the development of genetic technologies up to 2027 is aimed at responding to a number of grand challenges including health problems, food security and environmental sustainability. The role of science and technology in response to social challenges has been emphasized in a number of policy documents. However, there is a clear need for policy makers to better strengthen the linkages among the grand challenges and particular STI policy instruments, as well as to translate the grand challenges concept into particular policy actions.",
Slovak Republic,"The Slovak Republic is a small and very open economy, whose size is comparable to the size of regions in large EU countries. Slovakia continues to lag behind in the intensity of its business innovation activities. It also lags on expenditures for research, development and innovation (RDI) projects that affect practice, in technology transfer, in the use of cooperation potential, patent activities, in cooperation of research institutions with industry, in the use of venture capital and in a number of aspects conditioning the effective use of human resources. There is still a low level of cooperation between the institutions of science and research, education and economy in the development and growth of the competitiveness of Slovakia’s industrial basis, in connection with creating competitive innovative products, technologies and services.
Research and innovation are a weak link in the Slovak economy, as signaled by the following long-term trends (1989-2011):
-	A decrease in total expenditure on R&D and in the number of research personnel, especially in enterprises. Research personnel fell from 60,548 to 28,596 in the 1989-2011 period, which was accompanied by a decline in R&D expenditures as a percentage of GDP from 3.88% to 0.68%;
-	Increasing share of public funding of research and innovation. The share of enterprises in total R&D expenditures fell from 69% to 34% in the 1993-2011 period;
-	Loss of target-orientation and the growth of “untargeted” general research without clear thematic priorities. The share of untargeted and general research increased from 38% to 58% in the 1993-2011 period;
-	Increasing share of basic research at the expense of applied research. The share of basic research in the total funding of research and development grew from 22.6 % to 48.9 %, while the share of applied research decreased from 49.4 % to 24.6 % in the 1994-2011 period.

Reversing these trends requires concrete, clearly formulated and quantifiable policy measures for the 2014-2020 period. New strategies and changes in state economic policies are necessary, especially in relation to the funding and management of education, research, innovation and the support to business.

Due to limited resources and capacities, the government’s strategy concentrates on a limited number of priorities, which are defined based on the strengths and international specialisation of Slovakia. This fact has been reflected in the orientation of particular investment measures, so as to avoid fragmentation and to concentrate structural funds, public budgets and private resources on priorities with competitive advantage and with the highest development potential.","R&D is a fundamental precondition for the competitiveness and sustainable development of society and necessary for the long-term growth of living standards in Slovakia. Slovak R&D has a long-term tradition, and in some areas, performance is at world standard levels. The R&D potential in Slovakia is concentrated in the public sector (two thirds of R&D expenditure is performed by the public sector). As in other Central European economies, the National Academies of Sciences (and the departmental research institutes to a more limited extent) play an important role. Universities account for just 48% of R&D performed in the public sector. 
A significant barrier to the innovation progress of the Slovak economy is the relatively high proportion of basic research. There is insufficient support for applied research and a lack of institutions aimed at the transfer of scientific knowledge into practice. An exception is the R&D performed by departmental research institutes and centers, where applied research and subsequent development and knowledge transfer into practice dominate.","Firms face numerous barriers that constrain their propensity to innovate, including cost based factors, information deficits, and market factors, including a lack of demand. Cost based factors, such as insufficient resources within the enterprise or the relatively high costs of innovation in relation to an enterprise’s assets are among the main important factors limiting the possibilities of further innovation in Slovakian innovative companies. Innovative companies in Slovakia are also hindered by market factors, including the presence of incumbents and volatility in the demand for innovative products and services. A lack of qualified workers can also be to a certain extent a barrier to innovation, though this problem is hardly unique to Slovakia. Information deficits (e.g. on markets or technologies) is a more minor barrier and comparable to the situation in reference countries. Innovative companies use a lot of external information sources, notably business and technical publications. This bias provides insights on the character of Slovakia’s innovative environment, including the intensity of relations between innovative companies and other actors in the innovation system. 

Own R&D is not the only source of business innovations. Companies can innovate by buying machinery, equipment and software, external knowledge, or external R&D. As a technologically converging economy, Slovakia prioritises the purchase of finished technologies/knowledge in the form of acquisition of machinery, equipment and software. 

The share of knowledge-intensive services in Slovakia’s GDP and exports compared to other countries is very low, and the use of innovative processes in the areas of services, creative industries and the social sphere has only recently started.

Another barrier is public procurement, which does not contribute to increasing the innovation intensity of the economy.

The abovementioned constraints imply the need for policy measures that:
-	interlink innovation actors,
-	increase the technological level of companies,
-	increase the quality and availability of human resources,
-	enable the funding of development activities, and
-	use public procurement as a tool supporting innovation in the econom","Compared to the situation in more innovative economies, only a minor share of Slovak small enterprises considers the information from universities and public research institutions as important to their innovation activities. The situation is similar in medium-sized enterprises, where the most important sources of information for innovation are their customers or the environment in which the firms operate. In the case of large companies, when compared with more innovative countries, they attribute less importance to information from universities and public research institutions, as well as from consultants, commercial laboratories or private R&D. They attribute higher importance to suppliers of equipment, material, components or software. A contributing factor to firms’ not using universities and public research institutions is the insufficient quality and structure of the services they offer.","The government has specified societal thematic priorities that address the most pressing problems of Slovak society and present the greatest burden. Slovakia has a relatively adequate scientific potential in a broad range of disciplines of social sciences and humanities. The societal thematic priorities are as follows:

-	The aging population and quality of life, focusing especially on active aging, the health security of aging fellow citizens (including help in the field of mental health), social security, elimination of barriers for the handicapped, and friendly self-government. According to the demographic outlook, the Slovak population will age most rapidly in Europe. Therefore, there is a grave need to look for solutions that improve the conditions for an active life of aged people and their quality of life.

-	Multi-ethnicity, social inclusion and problems of poverty of some population groups. The government will focus on seeking effective solutions for those groups most affected by poverty, to identify objective and subjective reasons of the poverty. Emphasis will be placed on long-term sustainable solutions.

-	Employment of young people under changing conditions. The employment of young people after finishing their studies, and especially their first job, is a critical factor in the field of education and for the preparation of young people for work. Currently, there are many alternatives for the employment of young people, not only an employment contract. Opportunities include creative activities and starting a business. 

Although there is research capacity to better understand these issues, policy intervention will emphasise practical support mechanisms.","Based on analysis of the development of the Slovak economy, several areas of specialisation have been identified based on traditional sectors and prospective areas of specialisation concerning fast growing sectors, which have high potential for the development of the Slovak economy. The analysis of economic development, infrastructure and R&D capacities and their interconnection are the basis for the specialisation. However, there is misalignment between Slovak industry and R&I capacities. To exploit both potentials, it is necessary to create R&I opportunities for existing businesses and to create an environment for the creation of enterprises using already built capacities of R&I. The priority areas must also be consistent with the needs of the environment and society, to make the best use of the potential and synergies. In this way, it is hoped that the national and regional competitiveness of businesses will be enhanced, not only in local but also global markets, which will help to increase the overall competitiveness of the European Union.

The areas of economic specialisation are as follows:
-	Automotive and mechanical engineering industries
-	Consumer electronics and electrical equipment
-	Information and communication products and services
-	Production and processing of iron and steel
Development trends in the specialisation areas of economy are as follows:
-	to increase domestic value-added products, particularly through the effective transfer of technology and science and research results into the production process,
-	to develop production processes in industry focusing on better use of available resources, greater use of recycling materials and environment-friendly materials through RDI,
-	the use, placement and replacement of previously used materials for advanced materials with a new and more complex performance, including technological processing (machining, forming, joining),
-	to develop technological investment units, particularly in the field of metallurgy, engineering, energy and integrated industrial equipment, with respect to the application and use of light metals and advanced materials in the production of transport and construction facilities to reduce overall weight and contribute to the green economy, development and application usage of composite materials, 
-	to develop technological investment units, particularly in the energy and industrial facilities, with respect to internationalisation activities and the development of so-called ""Emerging countries“, 
-	to make more efficient the production and logistics processes,
-	to use ICT and robotics in the production processes,
-	to involve in supply chains and internationalisation - ""the purchase of cooperation is also a purchase“,
-	know-how transfer from large to small subjects and vice versa in the framework of the cooperation, and
-	energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.",
Slovenia,"The main objective of the Research and Innovation Strategy of Slovenia (RISS) is to establish a modern research and innovation system that will allow for a higher quality of life for all, critical reflection in society, efficiency in addressing social challenges, increased value added per employee, and assurance of more and higher-quality workplaces. In the last two years, the governance of STI policy was debated mostly within the framework of the preparation of the new law for science and innovation and through the support of an H2020 Policy Support Facility (PSF) exercise. The internationalisation of the science base and science-business cooperation have been two key issues of discussion. Regarding the latter, the main challenge is the mismatch between the activities of the academic sector and the business sector. The core question was how to align and improve governance and policy implementation for a more effective and sustainable research and innovation ecosystem, based on a strong autonomy of Public Research Organisations (PROs) and their social responsibility. Debates leading to the preparation of the new law included relevant stakeholders including universities, research institutes, trade unions, research agencies, ministries responsible for science and economy, chambers of commerce and young researchers. It also gathered feedback from the broader civil society. The debate was also opened as part of the adoption process of the RISS report, with the participation of the Science and Technology Council, the government and the National Assembly, where a broad group of policy makers participated. The results of the PSF exercise were presented and debated in the National Assembly, Parliamentary committee for education, science, sports and youth.","In last two years, government support for the public research system was debated primarily within the framework of the preparation of the new law on research and innovation, a process that aimed to involve relevant stakeholders. The main debate centred on R&D public spending, which dropped significantly between 2011 and 2015. While it slightly increased during 2015-2018, it is still far from the national goal of 1% of GDP. Other important issues debated included: (i) increasing the autonomy of public research institutes; (ii) institutional funding; and, (iii) strengthening knowledge transfer to the economy, particularly by opening the possibility for establishing spin-offs and spin-outs for public research institutes. The involvement of other sectoral ministries into the process of defining and allocating budgets for research topics was also discussed. In parallel, there were also debates about research infrastructures. Both options, building new ones and securing the access to international ones were discussed. A special issue is also the appropriateness of the governance system for consolidating policy funds for developing research and innovation potentials.","The goal of Slovenia's Development Strategy is to make the transition to a highly productive economy. This requires strengthening firm support in a globalised context, e.g. embedding companies within global value chains. Debates are underway to design and coordinate new strategies to integrate science, R&D, technology and innovation and economic policy. In the last two years, the government support to business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship was debated partly within the preparation of the new law for research and innovation. Debates included relevant stakeholders including universities, research institutes, trade unions, research agencies, ministries responsible for science and economy, chambers of commerce and young researchers, who stressed the necessity of consistent STI policy governance, currently a responsibility shared by two different ministries.","In the last two years, knowledge transfer and linkages were debated mostly within the preparation of the new law on research and innovation and through the support of an H2020 Policy Support Facility (PSF) exercise. Relevant stakeholders participated in working meeting leading to the law proposal and also at the PSF report presentation at the National Assembly, for the Parliamentary Committee for Education, Science, Sports and Youth. The main message arising from these debates was the necessity to strengthen the cooperation between universities, research institutes and the economy. 
Another prioritised area is improving national knowledge transfer capacities (a component embedded in EU structural funds). Here, the exchange of experiences, good practices, lessons and creating new common model are at the core of the debate. The aim of the activity is twofold, namely to create internal knowledge transfer capacities within institutions and secondly, to create a coherent knowledge transfer cross-institutional community in Slovenia. The Ministry of Education, Science and Sport finances transfer of knowledge and technology actions, which aims to strengthen and further develop knowledge transfer activities from the Slovene research institutes and universities to the industry and further consolidation of Technology Transfer Offices (TTO’s) and their human resources.","In the last two years, debates primarily took place within the preparation of the new law on research and innovation, with the involvement of relevant stakeholders . The main identified priority was the necessity to improve and support career opportunities for researchers. This could be achieved by supporting the cooperation of public research institutes and opening the possibility to award performance-related bonuses for their civil servants. Various new schemes arose from these debates, aiming to stimulate employment of researchers at the beginning of their careers. The instrument finances research projects that promote the cooperation between the public research institutions and enterprises. Other areas being prioritised is the mobility of researchers and establishing favourable conditions for their employment in Slovenia.","In the last two years, debates on how national policy for research and innovation can help address societal challenges were primarily conducted via the preparation of different sectoral strategies, for example the National Energy and Climate Plan. These strategies incorporate forms of support to research and innovation activities that address the most important issues (e.g. climate change) at a national level. Societal challenges are also to a certain extent addressed in the Smart Specialisation Strategy and as part of Slovenia’s participation in the new EU central programme – Horizon Europe.",
South Africa,"There was a reconfiguration of South Africa’s Administration following the May 2019 national elections. This has resulted in the merger of the Departments of Science and Technology and Higher Education and Training, an important step towards enhancing the coordination of the National System of Innovation (NSI). As governance framework, the promotion of a coherent and inclusive NSI is a strategic focus area of South Africa’s White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation. The South African Cabinet approved the White Paper as government policy in March 2019. The White Paper acknowledges that improved national STI policy governance is essential to enable the NSI to achieve its potential to improve the quality of life across all South Africans. Improving inclusiveness and building more linkages across the NSI is a pervasive theme in national STI policy discussions. Equally important is the enhancement of policy coherence and programme coordination in the NSI, including the appropriate ministerial governance. Interventions to strengthen the governance of pubic NSI institutions as well as the appropriate expansion of the NSI also feature prominently in the debate.

The White Paper also highlights the role of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems for effective agenda-setting in the NSI. Hence, how best to institutionalize M&E is an important focus of the national debate. This interrogation pertains to both the M&E skills required as well as the linkages between M&E of the NSI and broader international and government M&E frameworks (e.g. the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals). The institutionalization of a framework guiding public STI investment is also an important topic. The White Paper also proposes establishing a Presidential biennial multi-stakeholder summit (to deal with macro coordination and planning concerns of the STI system) and an Inter-Ministerial STI Structure, under the guidance of the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology to facilitate and enhance policy coherence, prioritisation and alignment of STI policy with other government policies.

A Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution has been established to determine the state of readiness and to advise on actions to be pursued by the country in dealing with its consequences. South Africa is also developing a reimagined industrial strategy as part of its efforts to boost the economic recovery and industrialisation efforts. Here, innovation and technology are also seen as critical.

There are a number of organisations undertaking policy-relevant research and analysis of the NSI. A first group spans in-house capabilities of the main policy-making bodies (including Departments of Science and innovation, Higher Education and Training, Minerals and Energy, and others that influence innovative activity across the economy and society). A second in-house group of bodies consists of larger STI organisations such as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and advisory bodies such as the National Advisory Council on Innovation (NACI) and the Council of Higher Education. The 2019 White Paper on STI has expanded the role and functions of the NACI to include M&E of the system, planning and agenda-setting and the institutionalisation of foresight exercises. Thirdly, there are important capabilities outside such bodies, mainly in academic organisations. This has three main components. The largest is located in the Human Sciences Research Council and has several segments, with the Centre for Science and Technology and Innovation Indicators (CeSTII) at the core having the responsibility for the national RDI surveys. There are also small research groups in at least the following universities: the University of Stellenbosch (Centre for Research on Science and Technology), the University of Pretoria (Institute for Technological Innovation), the University of Cape Town (Programme for Science Studies in the South) and the University of Limpopo (Social Innovation Centre).","Interventions to expand the knowledge enterprise in South Africa is an important part of the national STI policy debate. This includes an interrogation on how best to expand research outputs whilst ensuring the transformation of the research institutional landscape. Finding measures to best grow and diversify the institutional landscape, including by boosting the research capacity at institutions such as historically disadvantaged universities indeed dominate the policy debate. Also, ensuring an open, responsive and diverse knowledge system is a topical STI policy challenge in South Africa like elsewhere in the world. How best to respond to the opportunities and challenges associated with Open Science and Open Innovation are dominant policy themes in South Africa, mirroring many of the global debates. Other topics include how public investment should best target a diversity of knowledge fields, as well as how to address complex societal problems through inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches. The role of the humanities and social sciences within the public research system is another focus for STI policy debate in South Africa. Also receiving attention is the imperative that a successful public research system requires systematic efforts to upgrade and expand research infrastructures. The importance of increased internationalisation and the role of science diplomacy in advancing the public research enterprise are other policy themes interrogated.

The main success in South African public research system is the exponentially increasing number of scientific publications. The drivers behind this increase include the 2012 National Research and Development Strategy (NRDS) and the Research Outputs Grant. As a result, South Africa performs well in the scale-adjusted number of publications in comparison to BRICS countries and even some of the developed countries. However, these publications are more inclined towards humanities and social sciences. This is not surprising, as a relatively large number of doctoral graduates are in associated fields, such as education, business, law and administration. The publications with large activity indices are mainly those in which South Africa has a geographic advantage (e.g. astronomy, plant sciences and environmental ecology), targeted by the NRDS.

Despite South Africa having a comparably large number of publications, the system is mainly constrained in terms of the low number of researchers (1.8 researchers per 1 000 employed in 2017/18) and low level of R&D expenditure (0.83% GERD as percentage of GDP in 2017/18). The National Advisory Council on Innovation (NACI) determined that South Africa need to triple the number of its researchers and double the R&D expenditure in order to catch-up with other upper middle-income countries. 

There is a trend in which most of R&D funding and researchers are shifting towards the public higher education. As an illustration, the proportion of R&D expenditure by the higher education sector increased from 19.9% in 2008/09 to 33.6% in 2017/18. As result, most of South African R&D expenditure is increasingly directed towards the basic and applied research. The proportion of experimental development decreased from 46.5% in 2008/09 to 20.3% in 2017/18. On the contrary, proportions of basic research and applied research increased from 20.2% and 33.3% in 2008/09 to 26.4% and 53.3% respectively in 2017/18.","As part of its focus to promote an enabling environment for innovation in South Africa, the new White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation adopted a broader conceptualization of innovation beyond R&D. To enhance policy coherence and programme coordination in the NSI, it also adopted a “whole-of-society” approach to innovation. These policy shifts provide the context for a policy interrogation of how best to increase support for and encourage collaboration with the business sector in STI. Accordingly, the policy debate regarding support for the business sector focused on themes such as supporting R&D needs and targeted technology development and deployment supporting firms. Introducing SME-specific support is also regarded as a priority, whilst policy debates perhaps specific to the South African economic context relate to the revitalization of the role of State Owned Enterprises in innovation and the participation of the country in global value chains.

Other policy questions considered by Government in order to boost innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship include how best to support innovation for social and grassroots innovation, how to use public procurement as a vehicle to further innovation and the branding of South Africa as an innovative country to attract foreign investment. Also, progress has been made in establishing the Small Business and Innovation Fund. The injection of ZAR 1 billion into the small business and innovation space to de-risk the early stages of business and technology development will make these companies more attractive to large investors for scale-up.","One of the STI White Paper’s policy objectives stirring debate is strengthening the Government’s role as an enabler of innovation, including to address market failure and to encourage private sector investment. The role of Government to increase the geographic footprint of innovation in South Africa is also deemed crucial in this regard, with a specific focus on improved regional inclusiveness. The promotion of knowledge transfer and diffusion is also a policy priority in South Africa. Hence, pertinent policy debates address questions such as how best to support the commercialization of publicly funded intellectual property. Particularly pertinent is how to ensure that legislation on intellectual property rights from publicly financed research and development responds to the changing policy context. Given the imperative of harnessing STI for economic growth in South Africa, the national policy debate also explores possible policy interventions that harness news sources of growth. These include appropriate support for emerging industries, the greening of the economy and the role of digitization, especially within the context of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution. Equal attention is given to the role of STI in revitalizing existing sectors.
The White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation 2019 emphasizes the government’s commitment to enhance the spread of knowledge and encourage the sharing of ideas and research results by adopting an open science paradigm. Knowledge diffusion will also be improved through the enhanced coordination of STI activities across the NSI, which will facilitate the movement of researchers and knowledge between enterprises, universities, science councils and government. The increased absorption of PhD holders and other highly skilled workers into research-performing institutions will also enhance knowledge diffusion. Some of the mechanisms that will be used to achieve this are joint appointments and public-private partnerships. Also, the Government will support increased networking and the diffusion of knowledge by leveraging existing global partnerships and knowledge networks better, introducing specific programmes for the secondment of South African researchers to institutions in other countries, providing increased support for training abroad, and providing enhanced support for conferences and workshops.","South Africa aims to improve comprehensively the research system’s output of human capabilities and this requires several multi-faceted policy challenges to be addressed. High on the priority list, given the country’s history, is transforming the researcher base demographics, especially with regard to the advancement of black and women researchers. The STI human resources policy debate also interrogates broader education challenges, as it is impossible to consider postgraduate training without taking into account issues prevailing in primary and secondary education. Other policy debates revolve around the urgent need to attract global talent to South Africa and indeed reversing so-called “brain drain.” 

South Africa’s intricate social-economic “triple challenge” of poverty, unemployment and inequality demands a concerted policy focus on strengthening skills in the economy. A big focus is, thus, on the suitability of the tertiary education and training system to promote greater diversity. There is also a need to address education and training for a future of digital jobs. The human resource development debate is also informed by the ambition to support a science-literate and science-aware society.","Regarding inclusive economic growth, the Department of Science and Innovation’s (DSI) efforts in support of economic development include collaborating with other stakeholders to strengthen local systems of innovation. This support is key to expanding the geographic inclusiveness of innovation through, e.g. the Grassroots Innovation Programme that fosters the development of local ideas into innovative solutions. To illustrate, the DSI and the Department of Higher Education, Science and Technology (DHEST) have partnered in a venture to utilise the base of thousands of community learning centres, which are extensions of community colleges, across the country as innovation spaces to help unemployed young people to transform their ideas into innovations for commercial and social development. This will contribute to the development of local economies and help to address youth unemployment. This venture has kicked off with the DSI funding a pilot in a community learning centre in Bofolo, Eastern Cape.

Concerning the use of hydrogen-based energy sources, through technology demonstration with public and private sector partners, the fuel cell rural electrification project will be implemented in over 200 KwaZulu-Natal households in the 2019/20 financial year. The project is a collaboration between the DSI, the Department of Energy, the iLembe District Municipality, Bambili Investments, HyPlat and multiple fuel cell manufacturers. These demonstrations are critical to support the commercialisation of hydrogen fuel cells. The next step will include building a fuel cell manufacturing facility in one of South Africa's special economic zones, to ensure that all the components of the fuel cells deployed in the project are made in South Africa.",
Spain,"The central themes that have dominated the general debate on STI policy in the last two years in Spain include:

a) The process of preparation of the new Spanish Strategy of Science, Technology and Innovation 2021-2027, which is the overarching policy framework that guides and sets the priorities for central and regional government STI plans. Besides central and regional governments, different stakeholders (including universities, RDI organisations, technological centres, funding organisations, SMEs and industries, associations, foundations, etc.) are contributing to the agenda-setting and policy formulation of the Strategy. In particular, the Strategy’s design should guarantee external coherence with Horizon Europe and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Strategy plays the role of the national smart specialisation strategy for Spain and maintains internal coherence with the regional smart specialisation strategies.

b) The Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (MCIU), in line with the 2018 Communication from the European Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Europe, and the subsequent Coordinated Plan on AI, has worked on a Spanish Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) AI Strategy, which was presented in March 2019. http://www.ciencia.gob.es/stfls/MICINN/Ciencia/Ficheros/Estrategia_Inteligencia_Artificial_EN.PDF 

The RDI Strategy on AI informs the orientation of the future Spanish Strategy on RDI 2021-2027. Furthermore, the Government Delegate Commission for Scientific, Technological and Innovation Policy initiated in 2019 a process to elaborate the Spanish National AI Strategy (ENIA) in a co-creation strategy with 15 ministries of the Spanish government leaded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation. The ENIA aims at a common vision for national public policies by aligning the current sectoral and transversal state and regional plans with clear objectives and axes of action. The publication of ENIA is envisaged for the end of 2019. It will be accompanied by the launch of the Spanish Artificial Intelligence Capabilities Map https://mapa.estrategiaia.es/mapa.

c) The Council of Ministers approved in June 2018 the ""Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda: Towards a Spanish Strategy for Sustainable Development"". All Ministerial Departments, as well as the Autonomous Communities, Local Entities and representative organisations of civil society have participated in preparing the Plan, which includes priority areas of action, or “leverage policies”, i.e. a set of existing public policies and instruments that are relevant to SDGs. These include policies for scientific and technical research. 

d) The Government Delegate Commission for Scientific, Technological and Innovation Policy proposed in December 2018 the preparation of the Spanish Innovation Strategy for the Blue Economy and the creation of an inter-ministerial working group for its development.

e) The need for a broad Parliament consensus on science and technology has concentrated a significant part of the general debates on STI policy. This consensus involves a stable investment in R&D, including a medium term budget framework for the public and private sectors to reach the 2% goal for GERD/GDP. 

f) The government also took further steps to develop an evaluation culture for public research and innovation policy. Measures included the inclusion of STI programmes in the Spending Review of the Independent Authority for Fiscal Responsibility (AIReF) (Program for the Promotion of Talent and its employability and tax incentives for RDI); and the impact evaluation commissioned by the Spanish Innovation Agency (CDTI).

g) A central aspect of Spain’s R&D policy has been to ensure equality between men and women. The Spanish government is working to close the gender gap in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The “Women Science and Innovation Observatory” was created to guarantee equal opportunities and to increase the presence of women in scientific and university fields.","The central themes that have dominated the debate around the public research system in the last two years in Spain include:

a) The government’s adoption of measures for the employment stabilisation and rejuvenation of research staff in Public Research Organisations (OPIs) and universities. Additionally, progress has been made in promoting the excellence of research work and in improving the working conditions of research staff. Towards these goals, the statute of pre-doctoral research staff in training has been approved, and the “knowledge transfer sexennium” has also been launched as part of the evaluation university professors and OPI staff. 

b) The level and management of funding for the public research system. The scientific community demands a flexible, stable, multiannual and well-funded funding model that allows medium and long term research planning. In this regard, the Spanish State Research Agency (AEI) has taken the first steps to have a predictable and transparent framework programme. Its management capacity, in particular its IT resources, should improve accordingly. The necessary legal and governance model of the Agency to strengthen its independence is now one of main current debates.

c) The bureaucratisation (red tape) that hampers the efficiency and internationalisation of the public research system. Though several control mechanisms have been recently softened, the scientific community still demands a more efficient ex ante evaluation, management and monitoring procedures.

d) The instruments necessary to raise the levels of quality and excellence of the public research system as a whole, as well as the need to differentiate and support the best excellent centres and researchers. This involves strengthening the role of accountability and the systematic assessment of the economic and social impact of different instruments; and also the minimum requirements that the public sector staff necessitates in order to be accredited and have access to public research careers.","The central themes that have dominated the debate on government support for business innovation in the past two years in Spain include:

a) The relevance of investing in innovation activities to foster the productivity of Spanish firms. The underinvestment of business expenditure in innovation is hampering productivity, and there is an urgent need to improve the input and output additionality of public support programmes (direct and indirect) for R&D and other innovation activities.

b) The changing innovation dynamics calls for more innovative policy-making responses, with more directionality of government support for business innovation. In particular, the debate is on the need to foster the development of digital “general purpose technologies” to tackle societal challenges.

c) Under the Spanish State Plan for RDI 2017-2020, there has been a revision exercise of the public procurement procedures for innovation, to increase their effectiveness and to bring greater clarity and transparency for both procurers and suppliers. The improvement in these administration procedures has allowed more than 100 million euros of the 301 million that constituted the financial endowment of the FID Line (Promotion of Innovation from the Demand for the Innovative Public Procurement) for the 2014-2020 programming period to be committed in the first 10 months of 2019 alone.","The central themes that have dominated the debate on policy of knowledge transfer and links between the actors in the past two years in Spain include:

a) The launch of a new economic incentive to build industry-science and society-science linkages through the recognition of a variety of research related activities. It acknowledges the activities of researchers of public research centres and professors to transfer knowledge to the private sector (patents, confidential agreements and consultancies), governments (policy making experience, advisory roles, ..) and to society.

b) In late 2018, the Cervera Network came into operation, with the Cervera Programme of Technology Transfer, which finances the innovation of SMEs in collaboration with the technology centres and encourages the transfer of knowledge in Cervera priority technologies. Commitments of 140 million Euros were made in partially reimbursable grants in 2019. This programme follows a top-down approach with several technology priorities.","The central themes that have dominated the debate on human resources for research and innovation in the past two years in Spain include:

a) There have been specific efforts, and a strong debate, towards building a common scientific and technological career in National Public Administration, as indicated in the Science Act (Ley 14/2011, art 29), addressing the heterogeneity of professional groups of research officials in the different Public Research Organisations. Thus, a set of general criteria were established in order to normalize the different scales and professional groups and a compensation regime for the different Public Research Organisations according to their merits. A Performance Evaluation Commission of the scientific-technological activity has been established for the Public Research Organisations ‘staff. This regulatory measure aims at promoting and recognizing excellence, quality and continuous improvement in the professional activities of research staff in the public research organizations under the National Government. 

b) The need to increase the number of researchers in the public sector and reduce their average age. Recent measures have been put in place, notably the approval of the statute of pre-doctoral research personnel in training, which regulates a specific modality of pre-doctoral labour contract. This implies a clear improvement in the working conditions of thousands of young researchers.

c) The reforms to consolidate careers in research through a ‘tenure track’ system in universities and public research organisations, such as more flexible procedures to hire researchers or better regulation of the conditions of established researchers. 

d) The promotion of incoming international mobility of students and researchers, attracting talent and diaspora and recruiting in accordance with open, transparent and merit based selection criteria.

e) The low share of researchers employed in the private sector with respect to the EU average. In particular, the debate focuses on measures to promote inter-sectoral mobility and on the attraction of foreign talent in firms.

f) Measures to avoid biases and gender-related barriers to researcher mobility and promotion to positions of greater stability and professional prestige.","The central themes that have dominated the general debate on research and innovation for societal challenges in the last two years in Spain include:

a) STI policy has the capacity to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in various SDGs, creating synergies with several sectoral policies: energy, environment, infrastructures, transport and housing; or agriculture and fisheries. Accordingly, the Council of Ministers approved in June 2018 the ""Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda: Towards a Spanish Strategy for Sustainable Development"", involving the participation of all Ministerial Departments, as well as the Autonomous Communities, Local Entities and representative organisations of civil society. The Plan includes priority areas of action in which scientific and technical research is included as a transversal policy. 

b) The alignment of the new Spanish Strategy of Science, Technology and Innovation 2021-2027, which is the overarching policy that guides and sets the priorities for central and regional government plans, with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. There is a growing social demand that R&D and innovation needs to have not only an economic but also a social impact, and contribute to finding solutions to the challenges identified by society and embodied in the SDGs. As a result, the strategy should prioritise the generation of knowledge and the development of selected technologies needed to tackle societal challenges, based on the strengths of the Spanish research and innovation system.

c) The reorientation and alignment of STI policy and several sectoral policies towards the ecological transition of the economy, aimed at achieving the following objectives in 2030: 21% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to 1990; 42% of energy end-use from renewables; 40% improvement in energy efficiency; and 74% renewable energy in electricity generation, as stated in the National Climate and Energy Integrated Plan 2030, which devotes a dimension to research, innovation and competitiveness.

d) The need to reinforce even further the coordination and synergies between national and regional policies to guide R&D and innovation towards increasing citizen welfare, through more territorial cohesion.

e) The inclusion of SDG indicators in the monitoring of the AI National Strategy.",
Sweden,"System innovation for the SDGs, sustainable development, and competitiveness all raise the question of how to mobilise system transformation through mission-oriented research and innovation policies. Mission processes face several governance issues, including how to generate cross-ministerial, cross-agency and national-regional co-ordination? And how to mobilize for missions in the EU Framework programme, towards Horizon Europe?

Mobilising public administration for the digital transformation is under discussion. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that will fuel the next production revolution will contribute to a societal transformation. How will public administration keep pace with these rapid and complex developments, and adjust to this transformation?

Research funding is governed by research bills to parliament every fourth year outlining the overall structure of new funds or reassigning earlier funds. Innovation policies based on research is governed in the same bills. In addition to this, in 2014 an innovation council under chairmanship of the Prime Minister was established by the government. The mission for this council is to articulate the government’s plans and to counsel the government on strategic challenges to promote innovation.

Governance in the university sector is under ongoing discussion. Universities have a large degree of autonomy, but the discussion is focused on whether full separation from the public sector should follow. The Dutch system of ""Development contracts between the Government and the University institutions"" has been discussed as one way forward. Currently, the government is working on developing an indicator-based allocation of institutional funds.","The public research system has several lines of funding:
-	Direct institutional funding, whose allocation is based on historical allocations together with a reallocation of 30% of the funds based on quantity and quality in research, and of the degree of cooperation with industry and society at large. A new indicator system is under development to support the allocation of institutional funding. 
-	Funding for fundamental research from research councils.
-	Funding for cooperation with industry, which comes from the Swedish innovation agency, Vinnova. Vinnova handles a number of strategic cooperative programmes with industry. These are selected to meet the challenges identified by the innovation council. 
-	Funding for strategic research initiatives, which come from several sources, including the research councils and Vinnova. An additional source is from research foundations, which aim to support strategic research. A large part of this is fundamental research in areas of particular interest for industry. 
-	Research infrastructure investments, which are funded by a council for infrastructure within the Swedish Research Council. Funding for test and demonstrator facilities is also available from Vinnova. The research institutes, ri.se, are responsible for hosting these test and demonstrator facilities. 

The public sector funds R&D with about 0.9 % of GDP. Together with the investments by industry of 2.38 % of GDP, this gives a total investment in R&D of 3.28 % of GDP in 2018.","Start-ups and SME are strategically important agents for an experimentally-organised economy. The government is trying to find synergies between large and small enterprises by creating ""Innovation hubs"" (ecosystems of large multinational enterprises and innovative startups), which consist of incubators and accelerators that can be used by all types of companies. The government provides several instruments to foster such platforms for cooperation, innovation grants for startups being one such example. There are issues, however, around the governance, coordination and synergies between different agencies and initiatives, including EU funding.
While the overarching aim of the innovation hubs is to facilitate contacts between university research and companies, they can also include other activities such as facilitating access to university R&D by SMEs.","Knowledge transfer between science and industry primarily occurs when industry employs scientists and other skilled labour. Furthermore, Vinnova funds collaborative projects between research at universities and industry. The system innovation programme (SIP) is one example, which joins different research fields in a strategic area. The ambition is to move towards renewal of earlier initiatives, with a view to generating increased mobility to address the SDGs. There is also a great need for better IPR services to serve innovative firms. The government is working to develop services to address this obstacle. Research infrastructures and test and demonstrator facilities are additional arenas for science-industry collaboration targeted by the government.","The government has plans to increase the higher education of teachers, especially in STEM areas, in the medical profession, and in engineering. This is to meet the requirements of industry for qualified staff. In connection to this, research in those areas will be increased in order to have a sufficient research base for teaching. 

A special focus of the current government is to develop higher education and research in all parts of the country. This would require an increased research volume in smaller universities and university colleges. Life-long learning is also an important priority for the government. This is connected to having research and higher education in all parts of the country. It is especially important in the digital age where Sweden needs an agile labour market.","It is important that government investments in research and innovation have public support. To achieve this, it is important to get science issues into the public arena. This means scientists need to participate in general public debates on different political issues, such as climate change, societal inequalities, migration, etc., which should be underpinned by scientifically based facts. This makes science relevant for society, and is a particular priority for the present government.",
Switzerland,"This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

In Switzerland, research and innovation are considered key for common welfare, sustainable development, internal cohesion and cultural diversity. Research is the source of new knowledge, and innovation is the basis of market success. Research and innovation are therefore priority policy areas for the Swiss Federal Council. The Swiss education, research and innovation (ERI) system is considered efficient, coherent, internationally compatible and future-oriented. The Swiss Federal Council believes there are two primary reasons for this. First, the leading public and private sector actors pursue a partnership approach based on a common understanding that the ERI system should be developed cautiously. Second, both the Swiss Confederation and the cantons view the promotion of ERI as a high priority. Indeed, public spending on ERI has seen significant growth since the mid-1990s.

A strong political consensus exists in Switzerland that science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is governed successfully, and that its governance should continue along the same set of principles. Two recent major policy debates concerning STI bear mentioning. First, the Swiss Parliament adopted the four-year education and STI federal budget (ERI Dispatch 2017-20) after a prolonged debate about the respective priorities of strict budgetary discipline, and the need to strengthen the international competitiveness of STI and education. Second, the importance of full Swiss association to Horizon 2020 was a substantial argument in the policy debate about the free movement of workers between Switzerland and the European Union. In December 2016, the Parliament confirmed its support for the free movement of workers, enabling Switzerland to retrieve its full association to Horizon 2020 from 1 January 2017 onwards.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Switzerland’s high-performing research system contributes to the country’s high quality of life and excellent economic situation. Maintaining these standards is a major government objective, which explains why financial contributions to research and education grew faster than contributions to other areas over the 2015-19 period.

The discussions on research policy also included new challenges, such as supporting young academics and fostering innovation. Young scientists can be better supported by making academic careers more attractive (e.g. by opening up more permanent positions) and helping them secure scientific independence early on. In Switzerland’s federal education and research system, cantonal universities are mainly responsible for implementing such measures.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

In light of international discussions on the taxation of holding firms, Switzerland has committed to adjusting its tax system. A first proposal was rejected by public vote. A new proposal aiming to introduce internationally accepted instruments was adopted in 2019. The main objective of the new fiscal measures is to promote innovation. For example, income from patents and similar rights would be taxed at a lower rate, thanks to a patent box. A deduction would be granted for research and development (R&D) that is higher than the actual expenditure on R&D.

Furthermore, political initiatives (mainly emanating from members of the Swiss Parliament) are frequently launched to strengthen the Federal government’s innovation promotion. In this context, the national innovation agency (the Commission for Technology and Innovation) has been transformed into a new entity, operating under the name Innosuisse since January 2018. Innosuisse possesses greater flexibility in using funding instruments to promote research-based innovation, knowledge and technology transfer, and support for start-ups. It also benefits from greater international exposure through participation in European innovation programmes, such as EUREKA. At the same time, co-ordination and co-operation with regional actors is being enhanced, to exploit synergies.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

With the exception of tax-policy measures, Swiss innovation policy rests almost exclusively on knowledge-transfer measures. To encourage innovation, the Federal Government has prioritised financial support for competence centres and technologies outside of the universities. These centres should represent bridges between academic research and industries. The government has also supported the creation of the Swiss Innovation Park, a platform with five locations across the country where domestic and international companies can further their research activities, in partnership with Swiss universities and higher education institutions (HEIs).","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

In 2012, the Council of States Science, Education and Culture Committee issued a postulate mandating the Federal Council to report on the measures taken to fund young scientists at Swiss HEIs, and propose further measures in this area. The Federal Council worked closely with the relevant institutions to produce this report in 2014. The report underlined that the Confederation, the cantons, and the universities had already taken various coordinated measures to improve the situation of young academics at universities. It advocated continuing these necessary and important efforts. It concluded that the HEIs should be supported in adapting the career structures for young academics over 2017-20. As early as possible in their career, talented young researchers should be able to apply for academic positions that allow them to conduct independent scientific work and take on responsibility. They should also be given clear career options at an early stage. These measures would make academic careers more attractive for researchers in Switzerland.

Owing to the current structures of responsibility, however, the Confederation is only able to play a supportive role in this matter. The responsibility ultimately lies with the HEIs and their funding bodies, which can best judge the vastly differing needs of the institutions according to the subject area, the type of institution and the institution itself. One of the four funding priorities for 2017-20 is ""Young scientists"": a succession of highly qualified young scientists is vital if Switzerland is to remain competitive in international higher education and research. Hence, HEIs will receive support in adapting their career structures for young academics and scientists.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The Swiss research and innovation system generally defines its priorities from the bottom up. Thus, new topics of interest, including in the area of societal well-being and cohesion, can be addressed swiftly as soon as they become relevant.

The National Research Programmes (NRPs) of the Swiss National Science Foundation embrace research projects that help solve the key problems of today. Federal offices, research institutes, research groups and individual's propose topics and potential priorities to the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation. The Federal Council selects the final topics to be supported. It then refers them to the Swiss National Science Foundation, which will address them within the context of an NRP.

More top-down defined strategies or policies also exist in favour of societal well-being and cohesion. In the health sector, Switzerland has a master plan for promoting biomedical research and technology. In the social security sector, the Social Security Research Concept 2017-2020 has been developed. In 2016, the Confederation, the cantons and the municipalities issued a joint declaration in the “National Programme against Poverty” (www.gegenarmut.ch). The Programme discusses the development of a multidimensional national indicator system for the early detection of precarious life situations and the impact assessment of measures to combat poverty (“poverty monitoring”), and examines variants.",
Thailand,"Significant change in Thailand’s governance comes through the establishment of a new ministry, essentially merging science and technology with higher education. The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI) was established on 1 May 2019, bringing in four government entities under one roof, i.e. the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Office of the Higher Education Commission (OHEC), the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) and the Thailand Research Fund (TRF). The new ministry is now responsible for two important missions: the creation of human resources and the application of knowledge and innovation for the national development. It will enable a unified and flexible government agency to facilitate linkages between higher education institutes, research agencies and private companies through mechanisms such as talent mobility, technology transfer and education management. 

In line with the new ministry, a new policy council named the National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council was established in May 2019 to replace the previous the National Research and Innovation Policy Council. Similar to the previous council, this new council is chaired by the Prime Minister, with a designated Deputy Prime Minister and the MHESI Minister serving as vice chairs. The council comprises ministers of nine relevant ministries, leaderships of relevant organizations and no more than 10 experts appointed by the cabinet. The council has the following key roles: (i) setting a unified and systematic policy and strategy for higher education, science, research and innovation; (ii) approving the allocation of the national science, research and innovation budget to relevant organizations according to national strategies; and, (iii) monitoring the implementation of policy and strategy. 

Another important development in recent years is the official launch of the 20-Year National Strategy (2018-2037) on 8 October 2018, setting the vision for Thailand to have stability, prosperity and sustainability and become a developed nation as guided by the sufficiency economy philosophy. In line with this long-term strategy, MHESI introduced a BCG economic model (an integration of bioeconomy, circular economy and green economy) aiming to transform the nation to an innovation-driven economy by enhancing the competitiveness of both grassroots and technology enterprises and by attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This economic concept will enable SDGs through the promotion of sustainable agriculture; clean energy and responsible consumption and production; ensuring the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity; and protecting the environment and ecosystems. 

In 2017, Thailand’s gross expenditures on R&D (GERD) reached 1% of GDP for the first time, moving closer to the government’s goal of 1.5% of GDP by the end of 2022. In 2017 GERD totalled 155.14 billion THB (4.59 billion EUR), a 36% increase from the previous year. Private sector contributed an astounding amount of R&D expenditure at 123.94 billion THB (3.67 billion EUR), accounting for 80% of GERD; whereas the public sector (government, academic, non-profit organizations and state enterprises) spent about 31.20 billion THB (924.25 million EUR).","Under the newly-established National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council, a draft Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy and Strategy (2020-2027) has been formulated taking into account the government reform and domestic and international current situations. The 2020-2027 policy and strategy is designed into four platforms, each defining objectives and key results, stakeholders and sub programs driving forward the implementation process. These four platforms are: (i) human resource and knowledge institution development; (ii) research, development and innovation for grand challenges; (iii) research, development and innovation for competitiveness; and, (iv) research and development for area-based development and inclusiveness. Based on the 2020-2027 policy and strategy, a medium-term plan has been developed for 2020-2022 to accommodate the new 2020/2021 budget allocation scheme implemented as a result of government reform. 

The government reform introducing a new ministry and a new policy council has led to the administrative and budget reforms in Thailand’s public research system. Organizations in the new public research system belong to one of the following five categories: (i) policy and budget organization; (ii) funding organization; (iii) research and innovation organization; (iv) MSTQ (Metrology, Standards, Testing, and Quality) organization; and, (v) knowledge management organization. This categorization has resulted in the re-assignment of the roles and functions to some major organizations as follows:

-	The responsibility on policy and strategy is assigned to the Office of National Higher Education Science Research and Innovation Policy Council (NXPO). Previously known as the National Science Technology and Innovation Policy Office (STI Office), NXPO’s scope has been extended to cover higher education. NXPO also functions as the secretariat of the National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council.

-	The research budget allocation is managed by the Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) – an organization that has been transformed from the Thailand Research Fund (TRF). TSRI is responsible for managing the Science, Research and Innovation Promotion Fund and allocating the national science, research and innovation budget.

-	The National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), now part of the MHESI, is assigned the role of a research funding agency and becomes the sole agency under MHESI providing “general funding. The other two agencies with “general funding” mandate are the Agricultural Research Development Agency (ARDA) public organisation under the auspices of Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and the Health Systems Research Institute (HRSI) of Ministry of Public Health. 

-	Apart from the task of general funding assigned to NRCT, the tasks of area-based funding and industry funding will be assigned to organizations with certain qualification and expertise. Area-based funding requires the expertise in working with local communities and local administrative offices, whereas industry funding needs knowledge and understanding of various business components (e.g. marketing) of a specific industry, together with the ability to coordinate with research organizations.","In 2017, Thai R&D expenditures in the private sector topped a record high of 123.94 billion THB (3.6 billion EUR), accounting for 80% of the country’s gross expenditures on R&D (GERD). Innovation in Thailand’s private sector is very much on the rise, as manifested in the growth in R&D expenditure by 50% over a one-year period (from 82.70 billion THB or 2.4 billion EUR in 2016 to 123.94 billion THB or 3.6 billion EUR in 2017). This could be partly attributed to government policy and measures boosting innovation in firms such as the 300% tax deduction for R&D expenses, the Innovation and Technology Assistance Program (ITAP), the start-up voucher program and the Technology and Innovation Entrepreneurship Development Fund (TED Fund). 

The “Thai Innovation List” is also an effective program incentivizing innovation in firms containing innovations (products and services) entitled to fast-track treatment in government procurement processes. Innovative products and services submitted by companies are verified for their origination from R&D performed in Thailand and evaluated for the quality by a committee. Innovations passing evaluation are published in the Budget Bureau’s “Thai Innovation List” for a maximum of 8 years. Among new programs launched in recent years by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI) include: (i) the “Open Innovation Project” which supports startups and SMEs to acquire technologies and further develop into commercialized products; (ii) a product-based incentive program; (iii) the SMEs capacity building program; and, (iv) the economic zone for innovation. The Board of Investment of Thailand rolled out a tax incentive program for new high-skilled, STEM employments between 2019-2020, offering a 150% tax deduction to firms that hire new high-skilled, STEM job positions to enhance their productivity and innovative capability. 

Start-ups are considered the primary engine to drive the economy, especially an innovation-based economy. Recognizing that access to funding is one of the critical elements of start-ups, the government has launched a cooperation program with the World Business Angels Investment Forum (WBAF) in August 2019 with an establishment of WBAF Thailand Country Office. The office’s prime mission is to develop a robust local angel investment community for the Thai start-up ecosystem, connecting it with world capital markets and implementing capacity building program to enhance skills and expertise of entrepreneurs and investors. This initiative also enables Thai angel investors and aspiring entrepreneurs to have more opportunities to connect with global leaders in equity and capital markets. A new type of visa called Smart Visa was also introduced in 2018 to attract foreign investors, executives and startups entrepreneurs to invest in the targeted industries Thailand. 

In term of public research and infrastructure supporting industry, the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) announced its research strategy for 2019 onwards, aiming at enhancing competitiveness of Thai industry. NSTDA now directs its focus to develop technologies in the following areas: (1) Precision Agriculture, (2) Food & Feed, (3) Biochemicals, (4) Cosmeceuticals, (5) Biopharmaceuticals, (6) Precision Medicine, (7) Medical Devices & Implants, (8) Dual-use Defense, (9) Mobility & Logistics and (10) Energy. The strategy also places emphasis on infrastructure in the forms of National Science and Technology Infrastructure (NSTI) to support R&D and a National Quality Infrastructure (NQI) to provide testing and consultancy services to attend the growing demand for high quality product testing in the Thai industry. Five NSTI centers were established in 2018, namely National Biobank of Thailand, National Omics Center, Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, NSTDA Supercomputer Center, and Technology and Informatics Institute for Sustainability – all based at the Thailand Science Park. NQI currently comprises Electrical and Electronic Products Testing Centre (PTEC), NSTDA Characterization and Testing Service Center (NCTC), Industrial Ceramic and Houseware Product Testing Center (CTEC) and Design & Engineering Consulting Service Center (DECC).","At present, all intellectual property (IP) generated from public funding belongs to the government funding agency. This practice is an obstacle to the utilization of public-funded technology and innovation. In September 2018, the cabinet approved the draft Thai Bayh–Dole Act. Once the draft bill is approved by the National Assembly and signed by the King it will be published in the Royal Gazette. The Thai Bayh–Dole Act will grant ownership of inventions made with government funding to inventors. This long-awaited bill will greatly enrich the innovation ecosystem as it will (i) facilitate the commercialization of such inventions; (ii) encourage inventors to develop novel products or services to meet market demand; and, (iii) promote spin-offs and start-ups.

Science parks continue to serve as a bridge between higher education institutes, public research agencies and industry through an established R&D infrastructure, business acceleration programs and supporting mechanisms, including legal and IP service for technology transfer activities from research organizations to industry and market access service. Currently, there are four science parks in operation. Thailand Science Park (located in the suburb of Bangkok) is the base of research laboratories (biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials technology and electronics and computer technology) and testing facilities of the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) and over 80 local and international technology companies. Three regional science parks have been established in the North, Northeast and the South with each of them functioning as a networking hub with universities and enterprises localised there and focusing on economically important industries specific to each region. To stimulate the new growth engine, the Eastern Economic Corridor of Innovation (EECi) is being built as an innovation hub designed with a complete elements of innovation ecosystem forging science-industry collaboration in Thailand’s S-curve industries (biofuels and biochemicals, digital technology, aviation and logistics, medical devices, and automation and robotics). 

Food Innopolis is an outstanding example of a fully-integrated platform promoting government-academia-industry collaboration and knowledge transfer. Built for enhancing the competitiveness of local food and food-related industry (one of the largest in Thailand), Food Innopolis serves as a food innovation hub to accelerate the development of food innovations. Its roles range from (i) supporting industry to develop new products through advanced technology and innovation; (ii) setting up one-stop service center and service platforms to provide a complete service on research, development, innovations and coordination with relevant companies and agencies; (iii) supporting infrastructure for standards, testing, and food safety; (iv) fostering collaboration between enterprises and research bodies and promoting start-ups; and, (v) attracting international companies or individuals to collaborate with Thai organizations and make investment in research and manpower development in Thailand. Since its inception, its one-stop service center has welcomed more than 200 companies. Food Innopolis is based at Thailand Science Park and will be one of the four platforms offered at the Eastern Economic Corridor of Innovation (EECi). Similar to Food Innopolis, Digital Park Thailand will serve as a platform for science-industry knowledge transfer focusing on digital technology and business. The project to establish Digital Park Thailand is spearheaded by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES).","In 2017, the number of R&D personnel per capita was 21 per 10 000 people, with 62% working in the private sector and 38% in the public sector. This number increased from 13.6 in 2015 and 17 in 2016. If growth continues in this trend, it should not be difficult to reach the target of 25 per 10 000 people by 2021. 

A survey study conducted on research and innovation activity in industry revealed that the five S-curve industries (biofuels and biochemicals, digital technology, aviation and logistics, medical devices, and automation and robotics) will need a well-trained and highly skilled workforce to fulfil 99 000 new jobs in the next five years (2019-2023). Jobs in high demand include aircraft pilots, aircraft maintenance engineers, data scientists, full stack developers, robotic control engineers, mechanical engineers, chemists and biologists. 

The draft Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy and Strategy (2020-2027) identifies the work force development strategy in four areas:
-	Reinventing the University System: Setting the goal for universities to develop labour with skills and technical expertise meeting industry demand, developing excellence and creating international acceptance, providing access to higher education to all citizens and help strengthen the national innovation system. 
-	Lifelong Learning and Future Skills: Creating programs to re-skill and up-skill the workforce to address fast-paced industries driven by science and innovation, in the forms of short courses and curricula opened to full-time employees.
-	Entrepreneurial University and Enterprise: Aiming to promote an entrepreneurial culture in the Thai society in order to drive the innovation-based economy, by having universities taking on the role of “Entrepreneurial University” and developing an entrepreneurship ecosystem in universities to promote spin-offs and innovative start-ups driving growth.
-	Brain Circulation and Talent Mobility: Aiming to leverage on a limited science, technology and innovation (STI) workforce to drive ten target industries, by allowing the movement of personnel between the public, academic and private sectors, as well as attracting highly skilled labour from overseas. 

In the past few years, programs such as Talent Mobility, Work-integrated Learning (WiL), National Science and Technology Development Agency University-Industry Research Collaboration (NUI-RC), STEM education, Fabrication Lab continue to be implemented to develop the STI workforce to support the innovation-based economy and S-curve industries. The new Science for Industry (Sci-FI) program, launched in early 2019, aims to enhance the competitiveness of Thai industry by building a skilled workforce according to labour market needs. The Sci-FI program is a 2-year master’s degree program offered by Chulalongkorn University in which students will be placed to work for two years in the positions of assistant engineers or assistant managers at companies. During this time, they are assigned to work on product development, process improvement, or R&D as determined by companies. A new Industrial Postdoctoral, Postgraduate, and Graduate Research and Innovation Program has been introduced in 2019 to groom future researchers by providing salary support to research projects which hire postdoctoral, postgraduate, and graduate researchers. 

As a measure to attract highly-skilled professionals and talents to work in the S-curve industries, a new type of visa, called Smart Visa, was introduced in 2018. Smart Visa holders will be granted a maximum 4-year permission to stay, together with exemptions from typical work permit requirements and entitlements to additional privileges such as one-year check-ins at immigration (instead of every ninety days) and work eligibility for spouses and children. A tax incentive program for workforce training in targeted areas for 2019-2020 was launched by the Board of Investment (BOI), in which firms can claim 250% tax deduction on expenses spent on workforce training in targeted areas promoted by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI) and the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).","Based on the country’s strength in rich biodiversity and robust agricultural activities, the BCG economic model (an integration of bioeconomy, circular economy and green economy) will be applied to four S-curve industries (namely agriculture and food; energy, biochemicals and materials; health and medicine; and tourism) with the fundamental concepts of reusing, recycling and zero waste. Technologies and innovations will be employed to enhance the capacity and competitiveness of players in the value chain, both upstream and downstream, in all four industries. 

Positioned at the upstream of industry value chains is the farming sector responsible for biomass production, which serves as raw ingredients in many industries and local communities hosting tourist destinations throughout Thailand. At the downstream of the value chain are enterprises that employ creativity and high technology to produce high-value products or services, and in the mid-stream are small- and medium-sized enterprises. The BCG economic model attempts to identify product champions, technologies and mechanisms to implement technology adoption for each player, as well as measures to enhance the competitiveness of each player so that they can move up the value chain, i.e. by adding more value to their products and services. Examples of technologies for the farming sector are smart farming and precision agriculture that can enhance productivity and resource-use efficiency; whereas advanced technologies such as synthetic biology, bioprocessing, biorefinery, genomic technology, big data analytics, artificial intelligence are essential to develop novel and high-value products and services such as biopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, precision medicine, functional materials, and knowledge tourism, among others.

While the Thai farming sector serves as the backbone of the Thai economy producing biomass, feeding several important industries, the sector has been struggling with low productivity, resource-use inefficiency, labour shortages and an excessive use of chemicals, thereby leaving a majority of farmers in perpetual debt. These challenges can be overcome in part with technologies. For years, the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) has been implementing a program to introduce appropriate technologies and solutions developed by Thai research and academic institutes to enhance the capacity of farmers and local communities and help strengthen community enterprises and cooperatives. The program currently has over 30 technologies in its portfolio ranging from new crop varieties, to farming equipment, technologies for soil, water and pest management, post-harvest and processing technologies. The NSTDA works in close collaboration with other government and non-government agencies such as financial institutions, department of agriculture, and local administrative office to achieve this mission. The program has worked with over 700 communities in more than 60 provinces throughout Thailand (as per data collected between 2015 to 2019). Example outcomes include:
-	Introducing new or recommended crop varieties and training programs on technologies such as seed production and farm management. New or recommended crop varieties are available for rice, sugarcane, cassava, tomato, chili and mungbean. 
-	Technologies such as photo-selective film greenhouse, biocontrol agents, composting introduced to farmers and farmer groups wanting to minimize the use of chemicals, or switching from chemical to organic farming completely.
-	Improved market access for community products, by connecting organic farmer cooperatives to modern trade retailers. 
-	The transfer of rubber processing technology enabled a latex foam pillow manufacturing cooperative whose members are mostly rubber farmers in Southern Thailand to move upstream in their production process, and thereby adding value to natural rubber latex and increasing profits to rubber farmers.",
Turkey,"Following the results from the 16 April 2017 referendum, Turkey has adopted a “Presidential Government System”, a governance structure unique to Turkey. The new Turkish public administration system has a strong vision for (i) the empowerment of inter-sectoral coordination and cooperation; (ii) the diversification of consultation and negotiation processes to ensure coordination within the executive branch; and, (iii) to ensure stability and productivity in governmental processes. This vision will allow the executive the agility and effectiveness to achieve Turkey’s 2023 targets, i.e. 1.08 Trillion USD for GDP (gross domestic product), 12 484 USD for per capita income, 500 Billion USD for exports and reducing the unemployment rate to 5%.

The number of ministries has been reduced to 16 (comparable to international standards). Some ministries have been merged to better leverage the new presidential system of government. In this regard, the former Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology has become the Ministry of Industry and Technology according to Decree No. 703 dated 9 July 2018.
There are 8 directorates, 4 offices and 9 councils affiliated directly to the president, under the new governance system play a key role as the closest policy making and consultative/advisory bodies to the president.. Ministries are mainly responsible for the implementation of policies. Nine advisory councils affiliated to the President have been constituted in various policy areas; one of which is the Science, Technology and Innovation Policies Council (STIPC). 

The STIPC is the highest ranking advisory body on developments in STI policy, the monitoring of the national STI ecosystem and the introduction of STI policy strategies and recommendations. It does so in accordance with national goals for economic and social development and national security. It also makes further analysis and relevant advanced studies on the recommendations and actions approved by the President. The President of Turkey chairs the STIPC and appoints council members from among the top prominent academicians and leading private sector representatives from umbrella NGOs of industry, which has the capacity to represent major sectors. The council convenes once a week on a regular basis and reports to the President on a regular basis.

The STIPC undertook the task of determining priority technology areas for Turkey, as part of the government’s third 100-day action plan. To this end, the Council has conducted numerous quantitative and qualitative analysis gathering statistical data and expert opinions to determine high impact and feasible technologies to focus RDI efforts on. The Council has also prepared the “National Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy and Action Plan”, which has been presented to the Ministers, Vice Ministers and senior representatives of NGOs via a high-level consultation meeting in September 2019. The plan introduces a novel approach, which is based on impacts and outputs of RDIs instead of only covering RDI inputs, in order to determine socio-economic targets for STI strategies. The expected outputs and short-term and medium/long-term strategies are determined thereafter. 

In July 2019, Turkey adopted the 11th National Development Plan (NDP) with a 5-year perspective, i.e. covering 2019-2023. The plan lays down the main pillars of STI policies, emphasizing the need to develop the capacity to produce and use knowledge and to focus R&D and innovation activities both in academia and in private sector that support high value-added production, particularly through an efficient R&D and innovation ecosystem. Additionally, the Plan emphasizes entrepreneurship and commercialization activities tailored for different actors in industry (SMEs, big size enterprises etc) and the transfer of knowledge and technology (enabling socio-economic impacts of R&D results). In line with these objectives, policy initiatives cover research universities, public (affiliated to ministries, universities or independent) and private research infrastructures, various forms of government and legislative measures. Moreover, the plan identifies critical technologies foreseen to generate the most value added in the coming period of 2019-2023, in order to support technological transformation and increased competitiveness in priority sectors accordingly. The following mid- and high-tech sectors are prioritised by the NDP: chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, electronics, machine and electrical equipment, automotive industry and rail systems. The following technologies are prioritised: artificial intelligence, internet of things, augmented reality, big data, cyber security, energy storage, advanced materials, robotics, micro and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), biotechnology, quantum technologies, and additive manufacturing. 
The targets for industry and technology are determined within the scope of the “2023 Industry and Technology Strategy”, which has been prepared and published by the Ministry of Industry and Technology in September 2019. It was set forth to mark the 100th anniversary of the Turkish Republic, aiming for a robust industry sector that effectively leverages technologies. The Strategy has 5 components: “High technology and Innovation”, “Digital Transformation and Industry Move”, Entrepreneurship”, “Human Resources” and “Infrastructure”.","The Turkish government has been providing extensive funding for research, development and innovation (RDI) projects in universities, research institutes and the private sector. Recently, the main concern has shifted towards the impacts of project outputs upon the national economy. The need to carry out economic impact analysis of funded RDI projects has been highlighted in many recent strategies and policies mentioned in the Governance section. 

Key action areas around improving the public research system include: (i) prioritising technological areas; (ii) ensuring qualified human resources; (iii) cooperation and interaction; (iv) the commercialisation of RDI outputs; (v) increasing socio-economic conditions with the multiplier effect of technologies; (vi) basic science, interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity.

Additionally, the higher education system constitutes an important part of the public research system, counting close to eight million students with a vast geographical coverage across the country. This remains a key component for improving the research system in the country. The number of international students exceeded 140 000 as of December 2018, as a result of various exchange programmes, scholarships and other opportunities. This development is an important step towards the internationalization of our higher education system, as a means to improve the public research system.","Turkey has developed new policies to increase the country’s global competitiveness and to become more independent economically and technologically. These policies are structured under the National Technology Move (NTM) approach, which proved recently to be successful in the defence industry as local companies have gained important technological capabilities and gained significantly in cost-effectiveness. This approach will be extended to other industries. 

Turkey has established R&D infrastructure for NTM with 207 universities, nearly 1 200 R&D centres, over 350 design centres, 84 technology development centres, 153 000 R&D personnel and 112 000 researchers. As seen in global examples, technology movements are successful when output-oriented, university-industry cooperations are established. For this purpose, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBITAK) evaluated universities’ academic capabilities according to internationally accepted criteria in 120 focus technology areas. It is considered significant to create awareness of these capabilities in the industry sector to create fruitful partnerships. The NTM will also build awareness of the significance of technological development in citizens of all ages.

Recently, transformation of government RDI supports a more output and impact-oriented structure by improving evaluation and monitoring system. Although evaluation of the proposed RDI projects are realized by the assessment of many criteria including commercialization of the project results; projects should be more thoroughly monitored after the funding period in terms of value created by employment, tax, income, exports etc. Accordingly, as indicated in 11th Development Plan, public funds for RDI will be subjected to impact assessments.

In the NDP (2019-2023), an industry-oriented strategy was adopted to increase competitive production and productivity. In this context, a sectoral and conceptual prioritization approach has been developed to accelerate the technological transformation that stimulates productivity growth. In particular, the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry is considered to be critical. To this end, the NPD will launch the Model Factory (SME Competence Centre) Consultancy Support Program to increase the efficiency of SMEs and contribute to their digital transformation.

The strategy also emphasises public procurement that is oriented towards innovation and technology transfer. In Turkey, technoparks are one of the primary policy instruments to support innovative entrepreneurs. During the NDP’s 2019-2023 period, the institutional capacities of technoparks and technology transfer offices will be improved. The following mid- and high-tech sectors are prioritised by the NDP: the chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, electronics, machine and electrical equipment, the automotive industry and rail systems. The following technologies are prioritised: artificial intelligence, internet of things, augmented reality, big data, cyber security, energy storage, advanced materials, robotics, micro and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), biotechnology, quantum technologies, and additive manufacturing.","The Turkish government has increasingly emphasised enhancing the results and impact of its R&D investments. Various types of knowledge transfer channels are supported with the aim of facilitating interactions between science-industry actors.
In particular, collaborative research, researcher mobility and networking facilities have been emphasised by recently released strategies, e.g. the 11th Development Plan, the Industry and Technology Strategy 2023 and the National Technology Movement. Regarding collaboration, recently launched initiatives focus on co-creation rather than traditional knowledge transfer or sharing channels (e.g. see the Technology Readiness Level policy initiative). Support mechanisms are being implemented to increase knowledge and technology transfer through the cooperation of universities, research infrastructures and the private sector. Public-Private Sector Partnerships (PPPs) are also highlighted in the newly released 11th Development Plan. Turkey's ""National Technology Movement"" vision provides a framework for initiatives fostering the employment of qualified academic staff in industrial sectors.
The institutional capacity of collaborative infrastructures, which are independent or affiliated to ministries or universities, is being improved, while their effectiveness is being increasingly monitored through performance-based support system. In the new model, technology transfer offices (TTOs) submit their target proposals based on 14 performance indicators. TÜB?TAK assesses the feasibility of these proposals based on university level parameters such as the university’s age, the number of faculty members and its research budget. TTOs are expected to arrange their activities according to their specific targets.","Highly skilled human resources for science, technology and innovation (STI) has been considered an important means in Turkey for the circulation of knowledge and for the promotion of scientific and technological development. The necessary human capital should be readily available particularly for the growth of technology intense industries and the IT sector. Thus, this issue is crucial for Turkey’s competitiveness.
Recently, various policies and programs, such as International Fellowship for Outstanding Researchers and Industrial Doctorate Fellowship Programme, have been implemented by TÜBITAK on the development of qualified human resources in academia and industry. These aim to increase the quality and quantity of researchers in industry, promote the international mobility of researchers, increase the research competences in critical technologies and attract outstanding researchers to Turkey, among others. The Council of Higher Educations has likewise introduced a number of incentives to improve the quality of Turkish academic researchers in terms of scientific excellence, publication at high impact international journals, participation to significant international projects and similar quality measures, together with their contributions to industry.","The Science Technology and Innovation Policies Council (STIPC) undertook the task of determining priority technology areas for Turkey, as part of the government’s third 100-day action plan. To this end, the Council has conducted numerous quantitative and qualitative analyses based on statistical data and expert opinions. An extensive set of technologies has been assessed in terms of socio-economic impact and development feasibility (see Governance section). This assessment has not only considered emerging technologies and global trends, but also national R&D needs defined in national strategies. To estimate social impacts, various criteria have been determined in accordance with the European Quality of Life Surveys (EQLS), the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the OECD Better Life Index. 

Since 2012, TÜB?TAK has been preparing Call Planning for mission-oriented RDI funding programmes, both for industry and academia, for two-year periods that include priority areas, technologies and products to be developed in order to achieve specific STI targets. Recently, call studies’ prioritization efforts have taken into account current national strategies and technology roadmaps (e.g. the Input Supply Strategy, GITES) and global trends identified by OECD projections and EU Commission’s monitoring studies. TÜBITAK's Call Planning for 2019-2020 prioritises technologies enabling advancements in SDGs in energy and food sectors, notably: renewable energy technologies, low carbon technologies, food biotechnology and food production and processing technologies.

The Ministries of Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Urbanization, Agriculture and Forestry have their own studies related to Turkey's commitments to SDGs. Each ministry prepares its own strategy in line with the development plan, including support for research centres affiliated to that ministry, in order to develop technologies contributing to meeting their goals.",
United Kingdom,"The reform of the research landscape set out in the government’s 2016 White Paper, “Success as a Knowledge Economy” has been taken forward. The establishment of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) since April 2018 has provided scope for maximising the contribution of each of the component parts – the seven Research Councils, Research England and Innovate UK – working individually and collectively. UKRI works with a broad range of partners to benefit everyone through knowledge, talent and ideas. It operates across the whole of the UK with a combined budget of more than £7 billion.","Through the Industrial Strategy White Paper (2017), the government committed to reaching the target of at least 2.4% of GDP investment in R&D by 2027, and 3% in the longer term. This will require both public and private investment in R&D, and reaching the 2.4% target will require a concerted effort by the government and business. Government increased investment in R&D through the National Productivity Investment Fund with an additional £7bn over 5 years. The balance of research and innovation funding between disciplines and between discovery verses applied science are also topics for debate which will continue.
Through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF), the Government is investing in strategic innovation challenges that will create transformative opportunities for businesses and sectors across the UK. The ISCF brings together the UK’s world-leading research base with highly-innovative businesses to develop the technologies and industries of the future. In doing so, the ISCF aims to help solve the major industrial and societal challenges of our time. 

Opportunities to extend international partnerships on research and innovation for UK researchers and businesses were explored through an independent report by Professor Sir Adrian Smith and Professor Graeme Reid, published in November 2019. It included recommendations for increasing the agility of research funding to react to new and unexpected international opportunities, alongside means of accessing international talent, and building R&D capacity across the UK.

There is ongoing debate around where research is located, with specific policies, such as the Strength In Places Fund, aimed at extending excellence from the “golden triangle” of Oxford, Cambridge and London to the rest of the country. The Strength in Places Fund has the distinctive objective to support places across the UK to build on their specific research and innovation strengths to drive local economic growth. It will fund collaborative bids from consortia of publicly funded research organisations, businesses, and local leadership organisations, to undertake a flexible range of research and innovation interventions that will have a demonstrable impact on local economic growth. The level of research funding in the Devolved Administrations (Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) compared with England is also an area of debate.","The UK government’s Industrial Strategy, published in 2017, set out a framework to drive improvements in UK productivity. This included long-term commitments under five foundations of productivity including Ideas, in which the ambition was set for the UK to become the world’s most innovative economy, and the Business Environment, which set an ambition for the UK to become the best place in the world to start and grow a business. In addition to these five foundations, the Industrial Strategy also established a series of Grand Challenges to tackle global issues through which the UK could be at the forefront of major industries of the future. It also included the commitment to raising R&D intensity to 2.4% of GDP by 2027 and 3% in the longer term. Providing the means of supporting business-led R&D and innovation, and innovative entrepreneurship are components in achieving that target.

The UK is supporting firms to innovate across a wide range of measures, including the publication in June 2019 of the White Paper on Regulation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which sets out the UK government’s plans to ensure that the UK’s regulatory system can seize the opportunities of—and meet the challenges posed by—the emerging technologies and disruptive business models that characterise the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

The importance of national research infrastructures is clear in supporting business innovation and R&D. UK Research and Innovation completed a landscape analysis of UK national research infrastructures and found that over three quarters of those surveyed report that they work with business. Published in November 2019, UKRI’s companion report into “The UK’s research and innovation infrastructure: opportunities to grow our capability” has set out perspectives on boosting this capacity in pursuit of growing national R&D.

A review of the role and capability of government in science and engineering was carried out by the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, and published in November 2019. How government works with private sector innovators, and the role of public assets such as public laboratories in supporting science, research and innovation, were the subject of recommendations that inform this wider ongoing debate.

Addressing the regional imbalance in the spread of R&D and innovation is an ongoing policy objective. The Science and Innovation Audits, published in waves between 2017 and 2019 – led by consortia of business, universities and Local Enterprise Partnerships in England and relevant agencies in the devolved nations – are revealing distinct local and regional strengths and opportunities for collaboration across the UK.","Research and innovation, increasing the contribution of UK universities and of university-business collaboration are considered critical to achieving the ambitions of UK’s Industrial Strategy in increasing productivity and earning power – both to achieving the commitment to raising R&D intensity to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, as well as those for skills, enhanced productivity and supporting the place agenda. Universities work with businesses in various ways, including through collaborative and contract research projects, providing access to facilities, equipment and Science Parks, spinning out companies, licensing IP, as well as providing entrepreneurial support for students and researchers. The UK Government aims to stimulate, enhance and grow even stronger strategic collaborations between business sectors and academic disciplines and institutions.
The UK Government has a variety of levers at its disposal to support research collaboration and commercialisation activity. Research England (part of UK Research and Innovation – UKRI) provides funding to universities via the Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF) programme, to support and develop a broad range of knowledge-based interactions between universities and the wider world, which result in benefits to the economy and society. It is also implementing a new “Knowledge Exchange Framework” (KEF) to assess the effectiveness of English universities in collaborating with business and others, and at fostering knowledge exchange and research commercialisation. The KEF metrics have been developed with detailed consultation with the Higher Education sector and initially tested through a pilot exercise.
The UK Government is further developing?its plans for achieving the 2.4% R&D intensity ambition and?a key aspect of this will be how to maximise the commercialisation?of research and support the growth of younger R&D-intensive firms. Primary responsibility for detailed operational policy on commercialisation is being taken forward by UKRI. Through UKRI, the UK Government has made a number of significant investments to support universities, charities and businesses to work together; and UKRI is also reviewing its suite of support for research commercialisation and collaborations between businesses and universities. ","Science and research are key to the UK's future prosperity. To maintain and build on the current success in these fields we need to ensure that we remain attractive to the best global talent and enact policies that support and encourage all those with the ability, particularly those from currently under-represented groups, to pursue STEM studies and careers. STEM Inspiration / awareness raising activities, particularly those engaging young people, such as the CREST Awards and STEM Ambassadors, have an important role to play in raising awareness of the opportunities offered by the study of STEM subjects and the ranges of careers that such qualifications can lead to. Furthermore, improving the diversity and inclusion of the research and innovation system is an ongoing area of debate, as is the structure of research careers, where the flexibility of short-term contracts has to be balanced against individuals’ desire for stability.","Ensuring that all stakeholders are able to input their views into debates on the introduction and diffusion of potentially controversial new technologies is vital, particularly in fields that might have significant social and economic impact. The Sciencewise programme brings the voice of the general public into these discussions through the use of deliberative public dialogue. Recent projects have included dialogues on a Social Contract for Genomic Data, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles and the use of AI for targeting online advertisements. The Public Attitudes to Science survey also produces useful evidence of the public's trust in scientists and engineers and it's level of comfort, both with particular technologies, and with the overall pace of change.",
United States,"This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

In August 2017, the Executive Office of the President released a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on the administrations research and development (R&D) priority areas for fiscal year (FY) 2019. The Memorandum identifies US leadership in science and technology as critical to achieving the US administrations highest priorities, namely: national security, economic growth and job creation. The US administration recognises that federal funding of R&D programmes and the US research infrastructure can play a crucial role in driving technological breakthroughs. The Memorandum directs departments and agencies to develop and utilise quantitative metrics to evaluate R&D outcomes; support innovative early-stage research; and maximise the co-ordination, promotion and planning of their R&D programmes through the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).

The 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS), released in December 2017, identifies specific actions for the United States to ""lead in research, technology, invention and innovation."" The NSS states that the United States will build on the ingenuity that has launched industries, created jobs, and improved the quality of life at home and abroad. To maintain a competitive advantage, the United States will prioritise emerging technologies that are critical to economic growth and security, such as data science, encryption, autonomous technologies, gene editing, new materials, nanotechnology, advanced computing technologies and artificial intelligence.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Demonstrating a commitment to scientific exploration, the Presidents FY 2018 budget request is USD 151.2 billion (US dollars) for federal R&D investment – a 2% increase over FY 2017. Furthermore, the President’s FY 2018 budget request would result in the highest percentage allocated to R&D since the FY 2014 budget request.

The private sector funds and performs the majority of US R&D, but the Federal Government has an important role in funding R&D in areas where industry does not have a strong incentive to invest, as well as areas of special concern. Federally funded R&D has greatly advanced human knowledge, whose applications permeate our lives – from the phones we carry, to the cars we drive, to the medicines that return us to health. Recognising the critical importance of innovation in promoting America’s interests, including competitiveness, economic growth and national security, the 2018 budget supports investments in basic research, early-stage applied research and technology transfer efforts that will lead to future breakthroughs.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

In March 2017, President Trump established the White House Office of American Innovation (OAI), whose goal is to develop policies and plans that improve government services, as well as launch initiatives focusing on innovation. Three months later, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and OAI co-hosted Technology Week, which brought top technology executives to the White House for discussions with the US President and senior administration officials. As part of Technology Week, OSTP hosted the American Leadership in Emerging Technology summit, working with industry leaders to identify barriers to developing technologies in the United States.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

Recognising the cross-cutting nature of policies related to technology transfer, infrastructure utilisation, open data and workforce development, the OSTP has created a new NSTC Committee on the S&T Enterprise, which will be co-chaired by the directors of the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Undersecretary of Energy for Science.

The Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on the administrations R&D priority areas for FY 2019 states that US departments and agencies must prioritise funding basic and early-stage applied research which – supplemented by private-sector financing of later-stage R&D – can result in transformative commercial products and services. The Memorandum notes that strong partnerships with the private sector will be critical to maximising the efficacy of federal funding.","This text comes from the 2017 STIP Survey:

The US administration is committed to improving the technical training of the US workforce through science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and apprenticeships. Emerging technologies will present tremendous opportunities for job creation, but will also require a technically skilled and capable workforce to meet demand. To maintain US competitiveness and help ensure a domestic workforce that is available and qualified to undertake the jobs of the future, US agencies should incorporate STEM education (including computer science) and workforce-training opportunities in their programmes.

US agencies are to focus on policies and actions aiming to expand the STEM workforce to include all Americans (both urban and rural), as well as women and other underrepresented groups in STEM fields. To track improvements in these areas, they must develop quantitative methods or metrics and collect data to analyse the effectiveness of the STEM programmes.",[Left blank],
