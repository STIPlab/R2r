</p>","<b>Figure 1</b> shows the number of policy initiatives reported within themes belonging to the <b>Governance</b> policy area. The largest number of policies address <i>International STI governance</i>. This set includes a wide range of initiatives varying in scope, including strategies promoting the internationalisation of research and innovation activities, bilateral research and innovation cooperation agreements, participation in multilateral initiatives, and joint infrastructures or research centres. The second most recurrent theme is <i>National STI plan or strategy</i>, also capturing a variety of country agendas that set the national priorities for STI activities. The third most frequent theme is <i>Strategic policy intelligence</i>, grouping high-level expert groups or advisory councils, regulations related to evidence-based policy making, scoreboards, technology assessments and foresight exercises, among others. This theme is followed by <i>Horizontal policy coordination</i> (e.g. inter-ministerial councils and priority-setting mechanisms) and, lastly, <i>Evaluation and impact assessment</i> that captures key regulations, bodies and initiatives in charge of setting the country's overarching evaluation practices and mechanisms.","<b>Figure 2</b> indicates the frequency in which <b>Governance</b> policy initiatives address target groups (actors in the STI system). As it is to be expected, most policies are addressed to the <i>National government</i>. As shown further below, very often these initiatives establish national strategies or plans, which seek to provide orientation or coordination to government action. The next more frequently raised target groups are <i>Public research institutes</i> and <i>Higher education institutes</i>, also frequently addressed by overarching national strategies. <i>Established researchers</i> are relatively less often directly targeted compared to public research organisations. <i>Firms</i> are the most frequently targeted private actor in the STI system. Companies are addressed to similar extents regardless of their age or size, though SMEs are at times emphasised in policies. After this target group we find another set of research actors, i.e. <i>Postdocs and other early-career researchers</i>, <i>Private research and development lab</i> and <i>PhD students</i>. After public and private actors we find that a number of policies seek to involve <i>Civil society</i> as a whole, as is the case with <i>Subnational government</i> bodies (regional governance). Other target groups addressed by more than 100 initiatives include <i>Entrepreneurs</i> and knowledge intermediaries such as <i>Incubators, accelerators, science parks or technoparks</i>.","The most frequently used policy instrument is <i>National strategies, agendas and plans</i> (<b>Figure 3</b>). These strategies cover a wide range of national issues, often overlapping into other policy areas such as <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Public%20research%20system.html"">Public research system</a> and <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Innovation%20in%20firms%20and%20innovative%20entrepreneurship.html"">Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship</a>. Keywords indicate that research infrastructures, smart specialisation and social challenges are common topics covered in national strategies. Other frequent instruments include <i>Policy intelligence (e.g. evaluations, benchmarking and forecasts)</i>, used to advance policy learning with a view of improving the design and implementation of policies or seeking to fine-tune STI governance arrangements. <i>Horizontal STI coordination bodies</i> are often put in place to ensure the coherence of STI policy making by setting up mechanisms to co-ordinate different levels of governments. Another noteworthy observation of the figure is that keywords suggest that <i>Project grants for public research</i> are employed to promote international research cooperation.","<b>Governance</b> initiatives typically do not have any budget expenditures (<b>Figure 4</b>). This is particularly the case for <i>National strategies, agendas and plans</i>, which generally aim to set priorities for public investment in STI and identify the focus of government reforms without funding any specific actions. Initiatives reporting yearly budget expenditures fall within the <i>Less than 1M</i> and <i>1M-5M</i> ranges, often dedicated to cover operational costs of a government body or a mechanism associated to the initiative. This includes monitoring arrangements that provide scoreboards and foresights as forms of policy intelligence to inform decision-making. Initiatives with 100M EUR yearly budget expenditure or higher include highly strategic programmes funding research infrastructures and schemes addressing climate change, sustainability and societal challenges (see keywords).","<b>Figure 5</b> shows that <i>Portugal</i> has reported the largest number of initiatives in this policy area, followed by <i>Brazil</i>, the <i>European Union</i> and <i>Colombia</i>. The chart shows only the number of policy initiatives reported by countries and gives no indication of their scale or scope. The figure should therefore be interpreted with care.

As part of their response to the 2019 EC-OECD STIP survey, countries indicated the main policy debates around government support to their <b>Public research systems</b> (raw data included below in <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Public%20research%20system.html#nationalDebates"">Annex A</a>). The following issues were recurrently raised in national debates:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Several countries highlight R&D intensity targets as indicators used to gauge the state or progress of their public research systems. <i>Austria</i>, for example, highlights its national gross expenditures in R&D (GERD) amounting to 3.19% of GDP in 2019 and how this figure exceeds the European target value (3% of GDP). <i>Belgium</i> (Flanders and Wallonia) and <i>Estonia</i> aim to raise public R&D spending to 1% of GDP by 2020 and 2022, respectively. <i>Greece</i> and <i>Malta</i> have set GERD targets of 1.3% and 2% of GDP by 2020, respectively. The <i>United Kingdom</i> and <i>Finland</i> have set higher GERD targets though under a longer timeframe, i.e. 2.7% of GDP by 2027 and 4% of GDP by 2030, respectively.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">A central topic of debate concerns the criteria used to allocate public research funding. Countries often debate how funds are attributed using formulas that include performance metrics (e.g. publications, citations, PhD graduates, patents filed). For example <i>Iceland</i>, where funding for Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) is mostly based on student numbers, recognises the need to revise its model to include additional variables. <i>Sweden</i>, where institutional funding is currently calculated based on historical allocations (70%) and the quantity and quality in research and the degree of cooperation with industry and society at large (30%), is creating an indicator system to improve its methodology.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Some countries have sought to broaden funding allocation beyond performance-based criteria. The <i>Czech Republic</i>, for instance, now considers institutions' long-term strategy development and socio-economic benefits and impacts. The <i>Netherlands</i> seeks to ensure that the recognition and rewards system better reflects the core tasks of public research organisations (e.g. education, research and impact) so that the appreciation academics receive is better aligned with societal needs. Concerning the <i>European Union's</i> funding mechanisms, an area of debate is whether current evaluation and allocation mechanisms based on bibliometrics and peer review are fair.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">In some instances, discussions on funding allocation raise the issue of striking a balance between block and competitive funding. For example, <i>Korea</i> (where the rate of project-based funding ranges between 30-60%) is considering to increase the block funding ratio as a means to shape the roles and responsibilities of Public Research Institutes (PRIs). In 2018 <i>Norway</i> increased block funding of the technological institutes in its revised long-term plan research and higher education, a decision that has materialised  in the national budget for both 2019 and 2020. <i>Portugal</i> highlights calls to increase the share of block funding attributed to the research organisations, as a means to fund new government-led policy initiatives, e.g. a new scientific employment legal framework, which improves the employment conditions of non-permanent researchers leading to an increase in the cost of research personnel. If the block funding were to remain unchanged, universities will have to factor the new cost structure into the competitive funding that they are able to capture.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Another dichotomy frequently raised in national debates is whether to fund basic or applied research. The <i>Slovak Republic</i> and <i>Czech Republic</i>, for instance, identify a need to strengthen applied research. Countries such as <i>Brazil</i>, <i>Canada</i>, <i>Italy</i> and <i>Japan</i> raise the need to conduct research that can be readily used by industry (see <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Science-industry%20knowledge%20transfer%20and%20sharing.html"">Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing</a>). The <i>European Union</i> stresses the need to balance supporting two different kinds of research: (i) research based on predetermined top-down priorities (i.e. close to market and applied research) evaluated on the basis of impact; versus (ii) bottom-up basic research evaluated on the basis of excellence. In <i>New Zealand</i>, while there are arguments that it is more difficult to make a funding case for basic or ‘blue skies’ research due to it being harder to justify end-user benefits, this kind of research is deemed critical for driving innovation through expanding the scientific knowledge base.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Other countries underline the importance of leveraging research infrastructures. <i>China</i>, for example, seeks to promote the open sharing of large-scale scientific instruments and facilities composing the national S&T infrastructure, to serve STI actors, the economy and society as a whole. <i>South Africa</i> also recognises the need for systematic efforts to upgrade and expand research infrastructures. <i>Australia</i> cites how its 2018 Research Infrastructure Investment Plan is informing investment into platforms necessary for collaborative research in a variety of fields including high performance computing, health sciences, and earth and environmental systems. In <i>Iceland</i>, more effective investment in research infrastructures, including international infrastructures was one of the actions in the National Science Policy and Action Plan during 2017-2019. <i>Canada</i> has seen discussions on the appropriate roles in supporting the public research infrastructure at the federal, provincial and territorial levels as well as the private sector's, HEIs' and PRIs' responsibilities.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">National debates around the public research system are often structured with scientific excellence as a policy goal. This is a central theme in countries like <i>Germany</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Austria</i>, <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Cyprus</i> (to name a few), where various flagship initiatives are introduced with the goal of promoting research excellence.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Some countries indicate the need to strengthen the roles of regional actors in the public research system. In <i>Argentina</i>, for instance, a key discussion is the amount and distribution of federal budget for STI development, with particular focus on strengthening capabilities of less-favoured regions. One of the main components of <i>Russia's</i> national project ""Science"" is the establishment of world-class research and educational centers across its regions. <i>Germany</i> continues to strengthen its public research system through science policy that is largely implemented by joint programmes between the federal government and the Länder governments. One of the four pillars of <i>Thailand's</i> 2020-2027 Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy and Strategy concerns regional development and inclusiveness of R&D activities. The <i>United Kingdom's</i> Strength In Places Fund aims to extend excellence from the “golden triangle” of Oxford, Cambridge and London to the rest of the country. Sometimes countries see a trade-off between providing regional support and promoting research excellence. <i>Finland</i>, for example, highlights discussions on whether it should pool more resources to develop critical mass in larger research-intensive universities or continue to maintain a network of smaller HEIs in most regions of the country.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Frequent policy themes at the centre of national debates include the internationalisation of public research (e.g. in <i>Italy</i>, <i>South Africa</i> and <i>Spain</i>, among others) and the promotion of open science and enhanced access to research data (e.g. in <i>Iceland</i>, <i>China</i>, <i>France</i> and the <i>Europian Union</i>, among others). Accordingly, large numbers of policies address these themes (see <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Public%20research%20system.html#dataSnapshot"">Section 3</a>).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Finally, the availability of highly qualified human resources for research and innovation is often regarded as a critical determinant of the performance of the national public research system (see <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Human%20resources%20for%20research%20and%20innovation.html"">related policy area</a>). </p>","<b>Figure 1</b> displays the number of policy initiatives reported by themes within the <b>Public research system</b> policy area. By a wide margin, the most frequent themes are <i>Internationalisation in public research</i> and <i>Competitive research funding</i>. The latter includes different types of grant programmes and funding schemes allocated competitively, whereas the former includes various types of incentives encouraging the internationalisation of domestic Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) and Public Research Institutes (PRIs) or building international linkages through researchers themselves. The third most recurring themes is <i>Public research strategies</i>, containing national agendas emphasising the research system. This is followed by <i>Open science and enhanced access to publications and research data</i>, capturing initiatives that implement digital infrastructures and reforms or otherwise facilitate access to publicly funded research outputs. The fifth most recurring theme is <i>Research infrastructures and large equipment</i>, including large-scale infrastructure investments and roadmaps and equipment sharing schemes and mechanisms.","As it is to be expected, the largest portion of initiatives in this policy area target public research actors (<b>Figure 2</b>). <i>Higher education institutes</i> (HEIs) and <i>Public research institutes</i> (PRIs) are more often directly addressed, though policies also target directly <i>Established researchers</i>, <i>Postdocs and early-career researchers</i> and <i>PhD Students</i> (in decreasing order). For all these public research actors, ""open access"" is a recurring keyword (obtained by hovering the corresponding bars in the figure with the mouse), which stresses the importance policies give to the accessibility of results obtained from publicly funded research. <i>Private R&D labs</i> are also targeted by policies, although much less so compared to their public sector counterparts. <i>Firms</i> are involved in about a third of policies compared to HEIs and PRIs. Keywords suggest that many policies targeting <i>Firms</i> promote research funding, addressing societal challenges and encourage science-industry linkages (e.g. via research infrastructures and smart specialisation strategies). Knowledge intermediaries play a more significant role in the <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Science-industry%20knowledge%20transfer%20and%20sharing.html""><i>Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing policy area</i></a>.","<b>Figure 3</b> shows that <i>Project grants for public research</i> is the most frequently used instrument to support basic and applied research. It is closely followed by <i>National strategies, agendas and plans</i>, which are widely used by countries to give strategic direction to public research organisations, research infrastructures and their role in contributing to technological development, innovation, open access and social challenges (see keywords). <i>Institutional funding for public research</i> is also a frequent instrument (usually with higher budget expenditures compared to project grants), capturing block funding and performance contracts for public research organisations. In HEIs, resources are often used to jointly fund public research and teaching activities. Another recurrent instrument is <i>Information services and access to databases</i>, employed through various kinds of entities (e.g. by libraries or research infrastructures) to promote open science and enhanced access to research data (see keywords). <i>Dedicated support to research infrastructures</i>, contributes to the creation of new facilities, resources and services used by the science community to conduct research and foster innovation. <i>Networking and collaborative platforms</i> are also employed to foster research cooperation and coordination, often in international contexts and to tackle social challenges (as the frequent keywords indicate). Interestingly, some grants are also directed to the private sector, i.e. <i>Grants for business R&D and innovation</i> in the interest of fostering science-industry cooperation and public research commercialisation (see <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Science-industry%20knowledge%20transfer%20and%20sharing.html"">relevant policy area</a>).","Initiatives in this policy area that do not have any budget allocations typically include <i>National strategies, agendas and plans</i>, aiming to set out and articulate governments' vision for public research (<b>Figure 4</b>). This includes envisaged structural reforms and provisions for open access to research data (see keywords). As it is the case in most policy areas, initiatives with smaller yearly budget expenditures (i.e. up to 5 M EUR) are more numerous. These include grants funding research that are directly targeted at scientists. Initiatives with larger budgets place further emphasis on institutional actors, e.g. by targeting HEIs, PRIs and research infrastructures. The 'training' keyword indicates that initiatives with largest budgets (<i>More than 500M</i> EUR) often bundle R&D funding with teaching activities (this keyword is also present in <i>Institutional funding for public research</i>, as shown in <b>Figure 3</b>). ","<b>Figure 5</b> shows that the <i>United States</i> has reported the largest number of initiatives in this policy area, followed by <i>Italy</i>, <i>Germany</i> and <i>Poland</i>. The chart shows only the number of policy initiatives reported by countries and gives no indication of their scale or scope. The figure should therefore be interpreted with care.

</div>","<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">In their response to the 2019 EC-OECD STIP survey, countries indicated the main policy debates around government support to <b>Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship</b> (raw data included below in <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Innovation%20in%20firms%20and%20innovative%20entrepreneurship.html#nationalDebates"">Annex A</a>). Several patterns can be identified from these responses:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">A frequent overarching goal is to increase the private sector's share of national gross expenditures in research and development (GERD). In <i>New Zealand</i> and <i>Finland</i>, business expenditures are seen as critical to achieve GERD targets of 2% of GDP by 2027 and 4% of GDP by 2030, respectively. <i>Poland</i> and <i>Thailand</i> highlight how business expenditures have rose to 66% and 80% of total GERD in recent years, respectively.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">A recurring issue in national debates focuses on determining the most effective modalities of support. Most countries highlight growing roles of financial support. In particularly, several have indicated expanding provisions in tax credit schemes to answer a wider variety of needs. This includes <i>Argentina</i> (exemptions for innovation), <i>Chile</i> (administrative and staff cost for R&D; start-ups), <i>China</i> (angel and venture capital investment), <i>Italy</i> (digital skills investments) and <i>Poland</i> (income from intellectual property rights). Other countries emphasise the role of public procurement in promoting innovation in firms. <i>Finland</i>, for instance, aims to raise innovative public procurement as a share of total procurement to 10% by 2023, from its current level of about 5%. <i>Japan</i> is reviewing procurement practices to encourage the development and introduction of advanced technologies. Under <i>Spain's</i> STI State Plan for 2017-2020, public procurement procedures have been revised to increase their effectiveness in promoting innovation and to bring greater clarity and transparency for both procurers and suppliers.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Some governments seek to create a coherent and comprehensive mix of financial support, that meet a variety of needs specific to nascent firms, SMEs and larger, established companies. For example, <i>Belgium's</i> Brussels authority seeks to provide financial assistance across each step of the business innovation cycle. <i>Canada</i> aims to ensure a streamlined delivery of programmes to companies as they develop across various stages: from being established, to scaling-up and entering international markets. In <i>Italy</i>, an extensive portfolio of incentives was laid out to support innovative start-ups and SMEs at all stages of their life cycle, from incorporation to expansion and maturity.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Besides direct funding, many governments also discuss the provision of non-financial support. <i>Lithuania</i>, for example, aims to establish a favourable business environment through a package of measures, including start-up visas, business advisory support and the streamlining of licensing procedures. <i>Thailand</i> has built a National Science and Technology Infrastructure to provide testing and consultancy services that attend the growing demand for high quality product testing in the Thai industry. Several countries seek to improve the regulatory framework as a means to encourage entrepreneurship and business innovation. <i>Australia</i>, for example, is aiming to enact regulatory changes to counter a culture of risk aversion. <i>Brazil</i> and <i>Ireland</i> envisage reform reducing regulatory barriers to entrepreneurship. The <i>Netherlands</i> is finding the right balance in regulation for new forms of financing for innovation, such as crowdfunding.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Many governments emphasise specific support directed to SMEs. For instance, <i>Germany</i> seeks to motivate and enable especially SMEs and young enterprises/start-ups to innovate through networks and clusters and thus strengthen their market position. <i>Ireland</i> has identified raising productivity growth in SMEs and increasing the business start-up rate as critical challenges. The <i>Netherlands</i> is establishing field labs that place equipment at the disposal of SMEs for testing through small scale production, with coaching and training (e.g. for 3-D printing, handling composite materials). <i>Sweden</i>, viewing start-ups and SME as strategically important, is creating ecosystems of incubators and accelerators that link large multinational enterprises with innovative start-ups.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">National debates on support to business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship often spin around specific sectors and/or technologies. Several EU Member countries, such as <i>Cyprus</i>, <i>Estonia</i>, <i>Latvia</i> and <i>Romania</i>, structure their policy initiatives around smart specialisation strategies that target specific business sectors. The <i>European Union</i> shapes its agenda around strategic Key Enabling Technologies (KETs): advanced materials and nanotechnology, photonics and micro- and nano-electronics, life science technologies, advanced manufacturing and processing, artificial intelligence and digital security and connectivity. Many countries seek to harness opportunities brought by digitalisation and the so-called fourth industrial revolution. <i>Turkey's</i> National Development Plan 2019-2023, for example, prioritises areas such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, augmented reality, big data and cyber security. <i>Belgium's</i> Flemish authority is developing an integrated agenda for digital entrepreneurship and innovation. <i>Portugal</i> is seeking to accelerate the adoption of its digital transformation agenda by the business fabric, promoting national technological suppliers as industry 4.0 players to become an attractive pole for related investments. The <i>Russian Federation's</i> National Programme ""Digital Economy"" provides a number of new grants and subsidies to support innovative SMEs within the IT sector.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Finally, another salient trend in national debates concerns seizing opportunities of business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship to address societal challenges. <i>Finland's</i> government programme for 2019-2023, for instance, aims at creating international billion euro ecosystems that provide solutions to global societal challenges. The <i>United Kingdom'</i> Industrial Strategy also establishes a series of Grand Challenges to tackle global issues through which the country could be at the forefront of major industries of the future. <i>Spain</i> recognises the pressing need of fostering the development of digital “general purpose technologies” to tackle societal challenges. More information and analysis on initiatives addressing these challenges is available in the <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Research%20and%20innovation%20for%20society.html"">Research and innovation for society</a> policy area.</p>","Themes within the <b>Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship</b> policy area are ranked in <b>Figure 1</b> by the number of initiatives addressing them. By a wide margin, the most frequently addressed theme is <i>Financial support to business R&D and innovation</i>, covering various types of funding schemes such as tax incentives, grants and debt financing programmes. Secondly comes <i>Targeted support to SMEs</i>, including various types of policies addressed to firms of this size (as opposed to large firms or companies in general). Policies supporting SMEs often include specific grants and subsidies, innovation vouchers and technology extension services, among other forms of support. This theme is followed by <i>Non-financial support to business R&D and innovation</i>, which consists of programs for the provision of non-monetary assistance such as technical expertise, training, mentoring, networking and marketing and advertising support. The fourth most recurrent theme is oriented to another class of firms, i.e. <i>Targeted support to young innovative enterprises</i>. It includes policy initiatives supporting the emergence and/or development of new innovative firms, such as specific programmes for start-ups. The fifth theme with most policies is <i>Access to finance for innovation</i>, covering incentives for business angels, venture capital investors and other types of investments allowing companies to raise funding.","While, unsurprisingly, <b>Figure 2</b> shows that <i>Firms</i> are the most frequently addressed target group, it is worth noting how many more policies address a specific size (<i>SMEs</i>) compared to firms by age (<i>Young firms (1 to 5 years old)</i>). SMEs are followed by <i>Entrepreneurs</i>, with keywords (obtained when hovering the corresponding bar with the mouse pointer) suggesting that many policies relate to start-ups, venture capital, business development and training. Some of these policies also target <i>Private investors</i>, seeking to encourage their contribution to the entrepreneurial activity. Many policies involve <i>Public research institutes</i>, <i>Higher education institutes</i> and <i>Established researchers</i> as well, e.g. aiming to commercialise the knowledge produced by these research actors and also fostering public-private collaborative projects. The <i>National government</i> is at times a beneficiary of these initiatives, for example in the procurement of R&D and innovation that benefits a public service or in national innovation strategies and plans. Several reported policies aim to address knowledge intermediaries: primarily <i>Incubators, accellerators, science parks or technoparks</i> but also <i>Industry associations</i> and <i>Technology transfer offices</i>.","Following a similar pattern as in the <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Public%20research%20system.html"">Public research system</a> policy area, <i>Grants for business R&D and innovation</i> are the most frequently used policy instrument, followed by <i>National strategies, agendas and plans</i>. There are more grants than strategies in <b>Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship</b>, however, as there is a relatively larger role for governance within the public research system. Business sector strategies usually address topics such as technology development, energy, artificial intelligence, sustainable development and other social challenges (see keywords). <i>Technology extension and business advisory services</i> are used as the main form of non-financial support. These services cover aspects such as operations, production, quality, logistics, workforce skills, learning capabilities and the adoption of new technologies. They often have the objective of increasing firm productivity and efficiency. Another common form of non-financial support is <i>Networking and collaborative platforms</i>, aiming to gather actors for various business-oriented goals such as building entrepreneurial networks, collaborative research projects and technology development around specific fields, e.g. artificial intelligence and energy. Concerning innovative entrepreneurship, <i>Equity funding</i> plays a major role in promoting access to finance for start-ups, young firms and SMEs. Policies using this instrument often involve business angels and investment funds to promote seed funds and venture capital (see keywords). Finally, while relatively not numerous in the database, <i>Corporate tax relief for R&D and innovation</i> are a key instrument, allocating large amounts of indirect funding to firms' STI activities via tax credits, as highlighted below.","Initiatives within the <b>Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship</b> policy area reporting budget data often fall within the <i>1M-5M</i> and <i>5M-20M</i> EUR yearly expenditures (<b>Figure 4</b>). Keywords indicate that initiatives within these ranges often address start-ups and SMEs and include forms of non-financial support (i.e. expertise, knowledge transfer and training) in addition to financial aid. Initiatives with higher budgets appear to be more frequently associated with collaborations involving research actors, i.e. seeking to help firms leverage public research results (see the  <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Science-industry%20knowledge%20transfer%20and%20sharing.html"">Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing</a> policy area). Schemes using <i>Corporate tax relief for R&D and innovation</i> usually allocate the largest funds, as indicated by the keywords for budget ranges superior to 100M EUR. Across all ranges, 'commercialisation' is a recurrent keyword, which highlights how these policies recurrently prioritise bringing research, technologies and innovations to markets.","<b>Figure 5</b> shows that <i>Portugal</i> has reported the largest number of initiatives in this policy area, followed by <i>Ireland</i>, the <i>United Kingdom</i> and <i>Austria</i>. The chart shows only the number of policy initiatives reported by countries and gives no indication of their scale or scope. The figure should therefore be interpreted with care.

</div>","<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">
Countries indicated the main policy debates around government support to <b>Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing</b> in their response to the 2019 EC-OECD STIP survey (raw data included below in <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Science-industry%20knowledge%20transfer%20and%20sharing.html#nationalDebates"">Annex A</a>). A number of salient patterns can be identified from these responses:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Various European countries highlight knowledge transfer as a core goal of within some of their national strategies, agendas and plans. The <i>United Kingdom’s</i> Industrial Strategy, for example, considers increasing university-business collaboration as critical to raise R&D intensity to 2.4% of GDP by 2027. Discussions around <i>Portugal's</i> Strategy Portugal 2030 included the development of scientific knowledge for different business segments and mobilising actors for research and innovation impact, among other topics related to knowledge transfer. <i>Estonia’s</i> new R&D and Innovation (RDI) strategy places strong focus on building the capacity of knowledge transfer and on improving business-university linkages, including strengthening the technology transfer offices in universities, developing innovation services and providing additional funding schemes for technology-intensive start-ups. In developing its new Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) 2030 strategy, <i>Austria</i> tasked one of five thematic working groups with the topic of applied research and impact on economy and society, indicating that knowledge transfer will be an important component of the strategy. Moreover, the <i>European Union’s</i> Horizon Europe will give emphasis to the exploitation and valorisation of research results by introducing associated criteria in the rules for participating in and implementing the framework programme.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">A few countries, including <i>Korea</i>, <i>Brazil</i>, and <i>Slovak Republic</i>, stressed a mismatch between supply and demand of knowledge as an important obstacle for science-industry technology transfer. Besides this, the main framework condition cited in national debates as critical to improve knowledge transfer is the intellectual property (IP) rights regime. In particular, whether it facilitates public research organisations and firms to conduct joint research, and if it suppors the co-ownership, commercialisation or licencing of public research results. Various countries, such as <i>Norway</i>, <i>Sweden</i> and <i>South Africa</i> recognise deficiencies in their IP regimes, whereas others point towards major initiatives seeking to strengthen them. <i>Canada’s</i> Intellectual Property Strategy, for example, will launch a number of IP resources and legislation that is expected to make it easier for business to look for university-owned IP. <i>Ireland’s</i> Innovation 2020 strategy supports the creation of an intellectual property regime that encourages the creation of proprietary knowledge and its diffusion. <i>China</i> aims to promote mixed ownership of IP stemming from joint scientific and technological achievements.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Countries also promote the adoption of open innovation, open science and enhanced access to research data as a means to foster knowledge transfer. For instance, one of <i>Germany’s</i> 12 missions of the High-Tech Strategy 2025 is about new sources for new knowledge, focusing on opportunities offered by open access, open science, open data and open innovation. In <i>Austria</i>, open innovation is a cross-sectional topic in its new RTI strategy, whereas its 2016 Open Innovation Strategy provides a vision towards opening up the innovation system (including science-industry links). <i>Canada’s</i> 2018-2020 National Action Plan on Open Government implements open science initiatives encouraging greater scientific openness and research accessibility for the benefit of society at large. In <i>Norway</i>, by contrast, there have been concerns around the requirement for articles funded by its Research Council to be published with open access as of 2020. Critics argue that this hinders researchers from publishing in the most prestigious journals, with negative consequences for research quality.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">In parallel to setting up strategies and improving framework conditions, countries also debate the promotion of knowledge transfer using public investment. Two main types of measures can be identified from the responses submitted by countries: (i) setting up and strengthening knowledge intermediaries and (ii) funding science-industry collaborative research.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Regarding knowledge intermediaries, most countries refer to supporting science and technology parks, incubators, accelerators and, particularly, technology transfer offices (TTOs). <i>Hungary</i>, for instance, established the Science, Innovation, Technology and Industrial Park Network in order to achieve fully integrated cooperation between industry, research and academia.  <i>Thailand</i> continues to support its science parks as a bridge between public research organisations and industry leveraging an established R&D infrastructure, business acceleration programs and supporting mechanisms such as IP legal services and market access services. <i>China’s</i> National Technology Transfer Demonstration Agency continues to explore new mechanisms and new models of technology transfer services based on market demand. Several countries, including <i>Estonia</i>, <i>Israel</i> and <i>Slovenia</i> identify a need strengthen their TTO ecosystem and developing related services (e.g. project management, IP support). <i>Lithuania</i> created the Research and Technology Organisation, an association with the country’s leading research centres that seeks to consolidate the country’s potential in applied research. <i>Argentina</i> and <i>Portugal</i> highlight the launch of web-based platforms that enable directories of research actors and allow easy access to their competence profiles, outputs and activities.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Concerning funding science-industry collaborative research, countries often support this type of applied research in a number of ways. <i>Australia</i> and <i>Estonia</i> have added knowledge transfer metrics into their formulas for calculating the basic (block) funding of public research organisations. <i>Austria</i> has added similar criteria and conditions to performance agreements. Other countries fund specific projects, the majority of which through joint research grants or by supporting academic spin-offs (these are discussed in more detail below in <a href="" https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Science-industry%20knowledge%20transfer%20and%20sharing.html#dataSnapshot"">Section 3</a>).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Addressing the topic of human resources, <i>Norway</i> and <i>Portugal</i> emphasised the need for a highly qualified labour force, capable to lead interactions between research and companies, commercialise research results and adopt new technologies. In this regard, other responses raised researcher insertion in the private sector as an important policy objective. <i>Finland</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Italy</i> and <i>South Africa</i>, among others, have established industrial PhD programmes or identified a need to increase the insertion of graduates to businesses.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">It is noteworthy that countries at times orient these programmes towards specific business sectors and technologies. <i>Greece</i>, for example, launched a number of initiatives in Aquaculture, New Industrial Materials and Cultural Heritage, which are considered strategic for its economy. <i>Thailand’s</i> Food Innopolis is a platform promoting knowledge transfer in the local food and food-related sectors through a package of measures. <i>France</i>, <i>Germany</i> and <i>Italy</i> have initiated trilateral cooperation to promote the digitisation of the manufacturing sector and to support the <i>European Union's</i> efforts in this area. The cooperation brings together the implementing bodies of the national strategies for Industry 4.0 in the three countries: Plattform Industrie 4.0 for <i>Germany</i>, Alliance Industrie du Futur for <i>France</i>, and the Piano Impresa 4.0 for <i>Italy</i>. <i>Israel’s</i> Bioconvergence Strategic Plan, aims to reinforce incentives for university researchers to engage in applicative research that may benefit the industry in the biotechnology and nanotechnology sectors.</p>","Within the <b>Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing</b> policy area, the largest share of reported policies address three themes (<b>Figure 1</b>). <i>Collaborative research and innovation</i> is the one most recurrently addressed, gathering programmes that promote partnerships or other forms of collaborative projects between the public and private sectors. Secondly is the <i>Cluster policies</i> theme, including initiatives supporting thematic and/or place-based clusters (e.g. provision and implementation of networking infrastructures and financial support or incentives). The third most frequent theme is <i>Commercialisation of public research results</i>, which includes policies supporting the transfer of academic inventions via the sale, transfer or licensing of intellectual property, often on an exclusive basis, to existing firms or new ventures.","<b>Figure 2</b> shows that science-industry policies have similar numbers of public research organisations and firms as target groups. <i>Private R&D labs</i> are addressed by relatively a lower number of policies (by almost half). Besides organisations and firms, individual public research actors are also frequently cited, i.e. <i>Established researchers</i> and <i>Post-docs and other early-career researchers</i> for their roles in knowledge transfer and commercialisation policies (see keywords by hovering the corresponding bars with the mouse). These actors, together with <i>Entrepreneurs</i> are also often addressed in academic spin-off policies. Several policies also target intermediaries, which support science-industry linkages, such as <i>Incubators, accelerators, science parks and techno parks</i>, <i>Technology transfer offices</i> and <i>Industry associations</i>. These are often highlighted by smart specialisation strategies.","Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing policies are delivered through a heterogeneous mix of policy instruments (<b>Figure 3</b>). Grants are often allocated for firms or public research organisations, with science-industry collaboration as a requirement. Similarly, policies set public-private <i>Networking and collaborative platforms</i> to promote regional or thematic innovation clusters. <i>Technology extension and business advisory services</i> are frequently used to support knowledge transfer, research commercialisation and academic spin-offs. The figure also shows <i>Intellectual property regulation and incentives</i> is used with relatively high frequency (unlike in other policy areas). This instrument regulates and promotes the adoption of intellectual property (IP) rights and practices. It is often used by policies seeking to increase the capability for public research organisations to register and license IP.","Initiatives within the <b>Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing</b> policy area reporting budget data are more numerous within the <i>1M-5M</i> and <i>5M-20M</i> EUR yearly expenditures (<b>Figure 4</b>). There is little meaningful variation in the keywords across the figure's different budget ranges. It is noteworthy that initiatives with yearly expenditures of 100M EUR or higher often address societal challenges. More information and analysis on initiatives addressing these challenges is available in the <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Research%20and%20innovation%20for%20society.html"">Research and innovation for society</a> policy area.","<b>Figure 5</b> shows that the <i>United Kingdom</i> has reported the largest number of initiatives in this policy area, followed by <i>Ireland</i>, <i>Germany</i> and <i>Austria</i>. The chart shows only the number of policy initiatives reported by countries and gives no indication of their scale or scope. The figure should therefore be interpreted with care.

</div>","<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">As part of the 2019 EC-OECD STIP survey, countries described their main policy debates around government support to <b>Human resources for research and innovation</b> (see <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Human%20resources%20for%20research%20and%20innovation.html#nationalDebates"">Annex A</a> for the raw data). These responses can be clustered around a number of salient issues, described below.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">About a third of participating countries stressed the need to increase the attractiveness of research careers, both in the public research system and in the private sector. <i>Latvia</i>, <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Japan</i> (to name a few) aim to create the necessary conditions for researchers to foresee a stable career path in the future. Some countries identify shortages in human resources to fill in vacancies in universities and public research institutes. <i>Argentina</i> and <i>Portugal</i>, for example, report difficulties in replacing ageing academic staff. More frequently, however countries indicate that the lack of long term job opportunities harms the appeal of research careers. <i>Denmark</i>, for instance, identifies an excess of postdoctoral positions against tenure-track programmes. <i>France</i> seeks to revive permanent scientific employment by stabilizing the number of statutory jobs. In the <i>United Kingdom</i>, an ongoing debate is how to balance the flexibility of short-term contracts with individuals’ desire for stability. Other countries highlight the need of revising criteria for evaluating researchers as a means to improve career appeal. The <i>European Union</i> is devoting efforts to make recruitments in its research labour market more transparent, open and merit-based. <i>Spain</i> recently established general criteria to standardise professional categories in the public research system and redefine the compensation regime according to merits. <i>Estonia</i> is revising academic staff evaluation systems to value a wider set of career elements of researchers (research, teaching, consultancy and contractual work outside the university and self-development).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Attracting foreign talent for the private sector is another recurrent issue of debate, also raised by about 1/3 participating countries. Some countries identify shortages of researchers and technology professionals as a major obstacle for the growth of high-tech companies. In <i>Canada</i>, for example, this issue is addressed by the Global Skills Strategy, which aims to help firms recruit the highly-trained foreign talent they need to scale-up and grow. <i>Israel</i> is also ramping up resources to attract foreign professionals, which is recognised as an important bottleneck for the growth of its high-tech sector.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Various countries aim to stop and reverse the so-called ""brain drain"", i.e. the emigration of highly trained or qualified people. <i>Lithuania</i>, for instance, indicates this to be a main obstacle for its goal of strengthening human resources for research and innovation. <i>Greece</i> has secured dedicated funds to support domestic research and thereby dissuade its nationals to seek opportunities abroad. The country also devotes efforts monitor its highly skilled diaspora, particularly to facilitate cross-border networking and exchange of know-how. <i>New Zealand</i> is aiming to strike a balance in resources devoted to, on one hand, avoiding local talent from going overseas (e.g. with postdoctoral support) and, on the other, attracting foreign talent with unique skills.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">When it comes to strengthening human resources for research and innovation, as in previous editions of the EC-OECD STIP survey several countries emphasise science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills. Shortages in these skills are reported in <i>Belgium</i> (Brussels, Walloon and Flemish authorities), <i>Iceland</i>, <i>Sweden</i> and the <i>United Kingdom</i>. In <i>Australia</i>, there have been competing narratives in recent years concerning the oversupply of STEM graduates in some fields and shortages in others. Skills for information and communication technologies (ICT) are perceived to be critically scarce. In this regard, an emerging issue in the 2019 edition of the STIP survey concerns skills for digital technologies. <i>Sweden</i> and <i>South Africa</i>, for example, also see strengthening digital skills as an essential requirement to maintain the competitiveness of their national workforce. <i>Germany</i> is introducing a large number of new measures in the area of digitalisation and automation, including support for SMEs in their transformation to the digital economy. <i>Portugal</i> sees digital skills as an area requiring additional investment to unblock productivity gains in the business sector.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">With regards to modalities to build human capital for research activities, the onus is often placed on postgraduate education. <i>Latvia</i>, <i>Ireland</i>, <i>Japan</i> and <i>Hungary</i> (among other countries) highlight the role of master's and doctoral degrees to meet the needs of the academic and industrial sectors. One of <i>Portugal's</i> priorities is to reinforce funding for PhD fellowships to levels similar to those observed in the European Union. Many countries recognise the growing importance of lifelong learning and vocational training. In <i>Finland</i>, lifelong learning is seen as one of the main pathways towards increasing and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. One of the four pillars in <i>Thailand's</i> national strategy for human resources is creating programs to re-skill and up-skill the workforce to address industries driven by science and innovation, in the forms of short courses and curricula opened to full-time employees. This type of education is particularly relevant to nurturing digital skills in the workforce. As digital technologies permeate economies at a fast pace, the needs for skills in businesses change accordingly, thereby requiring upskilling broad sections of the population. Most of <i>Germany's</i> initiatives supporting digital skills, for example, are provided through vocational training.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Several countries point to gender balance and social inclusion as key issues to effectively address shortages in skills. <i>Australia</i> and <i>Belgium</i> (Brussels and Wallon authorities) seek to strengthen the participation of women in STEM areas, whereas <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Norway</i>, <i>Spain</i> and <i>Japan</i> highlight the need to support female researchers in the public research system. The <i>Slovak Republic</i>, the <i>United Kingdom</i> and <i>Canada</i> seek to improve the diversity and inclusion of  disadvantaged and under-represented groups in the research and innovation system. <i>Sweden</i> and <i>Portugal</i> share the common goal of widening access to higher education across less densely geographic areas, as a means to improve social inclusion.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Countries often question how well matched are the supply and demand of skills, while highlighting schemes that support the employment of tertiary education graduates and researchers in the private sector. <i>Chile</i> and <i>Colombia</i>, for example, emphasise their programmes helping the insertion of PhDs in companies and public entities. <i>Hungary</i> recently introduced “dual education” bachelor programmes that promote the collaboration between universities and industrial partners to provide students with formal opportunities to gain practice-based know-how, work experience and academic knowledge. Other countries, including <i>Australia</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Finland</i>, <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Estonia</i>, stress the need to promote the science-industry mobility of established researchers. </p>","<b>Figure 1</b> shows the number of policy initiatives reported within the themes belonging to the <b>Human resources for research and innovation</b> policy area. By large the most recurrent theme is <i>International mobility of human resources</i>, covering the reform of rules governing public sector employment and researcher recruitment rules, together with various mobility incentives targeted at researchers and companies. <i>Doctoral and postdoctoral researchers</i>, the second most frequently addressed theme, includes dedicated support to postgraduate programmes and rules and schemes for their evaluation, support to industry involvement in PhD training schemes and reform of academic curricula, among other forms of support. This theme is followed by <i>STEM skills</i>, which also includes the revision of academic curricula (across various levels of education) and the introduction of new learning practices and new instructional tools, among other types of initiatives fostering STEM education. The fourth most recurring theme, <i>Research careers</i>, refers to the creation of new job opportunities in public research institutes (PRIs) and higher education institutes (HEIs), improved financial rewards and non-financial incentives, and other forms of support for researchers.","Policies targeting individual actors are more numerous compared to those targeting institutional actors. The target group with the largest number of policies is <i>Post-docs and other early-career researches</i> (<b>Figure 2</b>). The keywords (obtained when hovering the corresponding bar with the mouse), suggest that initiatives are often research-oriented, provide support for training and fellowships and promote brain circulation. Similar policies are directed to <i>PhD students</i>, with an additional emphasis towards identifying and promoting new talents. Initiatives also target <i>Established researchers</i>, placing added focus on supporting career development through funding for research projects and fellowships. The figure also shows that large numbers for policies are directed at institutional actors, i.e. <i>Higher education institutes</i> and <i>Public research institutes</i>, to support their efforts in developing human resources for research and innovation. It is worth noting that gender balance is a recurrent topic across both institutional and individual actors. This is also reflected by the fact that several policies have <i>Women</i> as a target group, with keywords indicating support for training, emphasis on female researchers, an the promotion of talent and inclusion, e.g. in science and innovation councils. Governments not only centre efforts in the public sector, but also address <i>Firms</i> to support the development of human resources for research and innovation in the private sector.","<b>Figure 3</b> indicates that the most frequently reported instrument is <i>National strategies, agendas and plans</i>, which government use to give strategic direction to the education system. Besides strategies, policies frequently use <i>Fellowships and postgraduate loans and scholarships</i>, many of which are addressed to PhD students and aim to identify and develop human talent (see keywords). Another common way to develop human capital is through <i>Project grants for public research</i>, which often support young researchers in launching their careers as well as international research. Regarding internationalisation, several <i>Labour mobility regulation and incentives</i> also facilitate cross-bordeer staff exchanges through, for example, postdoctoral programmes or research stays. <i>Public awareness campaigns and other outreach activities</i> are useful instruments to promote interest and gender balance in STEM fields. This instrument also includes vocational training and lifelong learning policies. <i>Institutional funding for public research</i> is often used to provide block funding that is bundled with resources for teaching.","Among policy initiatives that report yearly budget expenditure in this policy area, the most frequent range is <i>Less than 1M</i> EUR (<b>Figure 4</b>). This range contains a set of small scale initiatives of various kinds, including scholarships, grants and awards and public outreach campaigns promoting STEM studies and research careers. Several of these schemes are oriented towards women, i.e. promoting gender balance across STI activities. A significant share of initiatives report yearly budget expenditures between <i>1M-5M</i> and <i>5M-20M</i> EUR. The keywords displayed in the chart indicate that these are generally oriented towards supporting research projects and offering scholarships at the doctoral level. Smaller shares of initiatives for <b>Human resources for research and innovation</b> report higher budgets. As observed within <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Public%20research%20system.html"">Public research system</a> policies, initiatives with the largest budgets include institutional funding schemes that bundle financial support for public research with support for teaching activities.","<b>Figure 5</b> shows that <i>Austria</i> has reported the largest number of initiatives in this policy area, followed by <i>Ireland</i>, <i>Australia</i> and <i>Turkey</i>. The chart shows only the number of policy initiatives reported by countries and gives no indication of their scale or scope. The figure should therefore be interpreted with care.

</div>","<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">In their response to the 2019 EC-OECD STIP survey, countries described their main policy debates around government support to <b>research and innovation for society</b> (see <a href=""https://stiplab.github.io/R2r/Research%20and%20innovation%20for%20society.html#nationalDebates"">Annex A</a> for the raw data). In their responses, governments highlight a range of societal challenges including ageing populations, health, energy security and social inclusion. In several occasions, national strategies, agendas and plans emphasise a specific challenge that is considered critical to the national context. <i>Korea</i>, for example, projects that 10 million inhabitants will be over 65 by 2025. In parallel to social welfare policies aiming to reverse the declining birth rate, STI policies will promote innovation for high-quality senior care and health services.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Societal challenges are often pioritised through national strategies, agendas and plans. <i>Norway</i>, for instance, introduced ""Blue opportunities"", a dedicated strategy for the maritime sector, promoting an international framework for sustainable ocean management. As a path towards reducing carbon emissions, <i>Hungary</i> adopted a dedicated e-mobility plan (known as Jedlik Ányos) supporting R&D and innovation activities related to the production of e-vehicles. <i>Poland's</i> Strategy for Responsible Development aims to foster inclusive growth for all, while also increasing social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion. National strategies addressing societal challenges are often framed by the United Nation's 2030 Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). <i>Belgium's</i> Vizier 2030 strategy (Flanders authority), <i>Brazil's</i> Social Development Strategy, <i>Spain's</i> 2021-2027 STI Strategy and <i>Canada's</i> 2030 Agenda, among others, have been explicitly designed to address SDGs.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">In several instances, the UN 2030 agenda also frames activities of key horizontal coordination that foster multi-stakeholder engagement. The <i>Greek</i> Economic and Social Council, for example, led consultations across major stakeholders and social partners to determine the SDGs the country should prioritise. When it comes to incorporating SDGs in STI policy, <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Japan</i>, <i>France</i> and <i>Germany</i> report flagship initiatives that involve various actors, including from the public research sector, industry, citizens and policy makers.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Addressing climate change is the challenge that gathers most attention among country responses. Through its “Green Deal for Europe”, the <i>European Union</i> established a roadmap for making its economy sustainable and carbon neutral by 2050. Aligning to this commitment and also the Paris Agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, several EU countries have introduced national strategies tackling climate change with a 2030 time horizon, including <i>Ireland</i>, <i>Slovenia</i> and <i>Spain</i>. <i>Austria</i> set up an intra-ministerial working group on climate change and resource scarcity, with a particular emphasis on the future global energy supply. The <i>Netherlands</i> reformed the Ministry of Economic Affairs in 2017, adding 'and Climate Policy' to its name.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Some countries tackle climate change and environmental sustainability through strategies dedicated to the bioeconomy sector, which covers the production of renewable biological resources and the conversion of these resources and waste streams into value added products, such as food, feed, bio-based products and bioenergy. <i>Costa Rica</i>, for instance, adopted a Bioeconomy National Strategy, a joint effort between four Ministries as a means towards sustainability that aims to reconcile objectives of productive development, environmental protection and the sustainable use of biological resources. <i>Ireland's</i> National Policy Statement on the Bioeconomy recognises its crucial role for sustainability while also providing an impetus to rural and regional development and employment. In <i>Thailand</i>, a Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economic Model is being promoted by the government as a new economic model for inclusive and sustainable growth.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Mission-oriented innovation policy is emerging as a popular methodology for countries to tackle societal challenges. In the <i>Netherlands</i>, for example, many of the SDGs were incorporated in 2019 into the mission-oriented Topsectors programmes around agriculture, water, food, health, security, clean energy, transport, and circular economy. <i>Turkey's</i> mission-oriented Call Planning for 2019-2020 prioritises technologies enabling advancements in SDGs in energy and food sectors, notably: renewable energy technologies, low carbon technologies, food biotechnology and food production and processing technologies. <i>Australia</i> is currently assessing the potential to implement a missions-based approach to policies addressing societal challenges.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-left:40px;margin-right:100px"">Some countries report ethical concerns around emerging technologies. <i>New Zealand</i>, for example, is considering reforming its regulations to give scientists greater flexibility and freedom in their use of gene editing technology. However, officials recognise that gene editing technologies also have the potential to be unsafe and pose biosecurity risks. In <i>Australia</i>, there are concerns on the possible disruptions caused by innovation, particularly adverse effects on certain individuals and communities, e.g. resulting in existing job being displaced and existing businesses becoming unprofitable. To monitor such concerns, the <i>United Kingdom's</i> Public Attitudes to Science survey produces useful evidence of the public's level of comfort with particular technologies and the overall pace of technological change.</p>","<b>Figure 1</b> displays the number of policies for each theme within the <b>research and innovation for society</b> policy area. The theme with the largest number of reported initiatives is <i>Science, technology and innovation culture</i>, including awareness campaigns (e.g. mass-media communications, open days and big events), initiatives promoting participatory learning techniques, major revisions of educational curricula and innovation prizes and contests. After this theme comes <i>Research and innovation for society strategy</i>, which gathers national agendas seeking to improve societal wellbeing and cohesion, and <i>Multi-stakeholder engagement</i>, containing initiatives aimed at orienting research and innovation activities towards societal issues and ensuring that their benefits are broadly shared across society. The fourth, least often addressed theme by policies in the database in this area, is <i>Research and innovation for developing countries</i>, which includes international technology transfer schemes, cooperative and joint research and innovation programmes, and initiatives to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals through research and innovation, among others.","The largest numbers of initiatives in this policy area are targeted towards <i>Higher education institutes</i> (<b>Figure 2</b>), aiming to support their efforts in addressing societal challenges. Initiatives targeted at <i>Public research institutes</i> also aim to incite them to contribute towards these challenges. Many initiatives aim to benefit <i>Civil society</i> as a whole, and thus this target group displays a relatively high number of initiatives in the Figure compared to other policy areas. A large number of initiatives target <i>Established researchers</i>, <i>Postdocs and other early-career researchers</i> and <i>PhD students</i>. The <i>National government</i> also displays a large number of policy initiatives, related to a high number of strategies, agendas an plans reported in this policy area. Policies also frequently engage <i>Firms,</i>, e.g. seeking to involve the business sector in addressing societal challenges. ","<b>Figure 3</b> presents how frequently different policy instruments are used in policies reported under the <b>Research and innovation for society</b> policy area. Countries primarily use <i>National strategies, agendas and plans</i> as a governance instrument that structures and aligns activities of public bodies and other policy actions in addressing societal challenges, e.g. through priority setting. Many of these strategies involve international cooperation (see keywords). <i>Public awareness campaigns</i> are highly cited in this policy area, compared to others. Several policies reported under the <i>Science, technology and innovation culture</i> theme (<b>Figure 1</b>) use this instrument. Besides these two instruments, the remainder of <b>Figure 3</b> depicts a ""long tail"", i.e. a wide variety of instruments used less frequently. <i>Project grants for public research</i> and <i>Science and innovation challenges, prizes and awards</i> address welfare, energy, sustainable development and other social challenges (see keywords).","The largest number of policies reporting budget information falls under the <i>Less than 1M</i> EUR range (<b>Figure 4</b>). These small scale initiatives, varying in nature, tend to promote societal awareness and appreciation of science, technology and innovation (STI) that address civil society as a whole. Many of them use public awareness campaigns and prizes and awards, as described above. Several initiatives between 1M and 20M EUR are more specifically targeted to STI actors as opposed to civil society. They aim to support STI activities promising significant contributions to social well-being, e.g. smart cities. Policy initiatives within the <i>100M-500M</i> and <i>More than 500M</i> EUR budget ranges include several large scale research funding programmes that aim to have large societal impacts (see keywords).","<b>Figure 5</b> shows that <i>Portugal</i> has reported the largest number of initiatives in this policy area, followed by <i>Austria</i>, <i>Turkey</i> and <i>Lithuania</i>. The chart shows only the number of policy initiatives reported by countries and gives no indication of their scale or scope. The figure should therefore be interpreted with care.

</p>","The <b>Emerging trends in STI</b> policy area contains themes of growing interest for EC and OECD stakeholders and the broader policy-making community. This area is composed of a set of themes that are specific to the 2019 edition of the STIP Survey. <b>Figure 1</b> shows that the theme with the largest number of policies is <i>Artificial intelligence</i> (AI), gathering schemes that support the development, use, adoption or diffusion of artificial intelligence systems. Special efforts were dedicated to collect policy data in this theme, in the context of the OECD <a href=""https://oecd.ai"">AI Observatory</a>, launched on 27 February 2020. This theme is followed by <i>Ethics of emerging technologies</i>, which groups schemes and governance structures aiming to help stakeholders involved in the development, regulation and use of emerging technologies to understand and/or address their ethical, legal, and societal aspects. Examples include laws and regulations, codes of ethics and best practice, standards, new ethics bodies or institutions, new mechanisms for public engagement. The third theme with the largest number of initiatives is <i>Mission-oriented innovation policies</i>. It includes meta-initiatives coordinating different policy measures, possibly spanning different stages of the innovation chain and cutting across various policy fields, in order to meet ambitious and concrete goals to address societal challenges. Next are technology-specific themes gathering flagship policies in the areas of biotechnology and nano and converging technologies. Lastly, a few <i>Policy experiments</i> were reported, i.e. novel approaches and/or methods for STI policy design and/or implementation (e.g. randomised control trials, pilots and testbeds).","<b>Figure 2</b> shows that most policies reported in the 2019 survey target public research organisations. <i>National governments</i> are also frequently addressed. Recurrent topics of the latter set are AI strategies and digital technologies (see keywords obtained by hovering the corresponding bars with the mouse). A large number of policies are reported for <i>Firms</i>, compared to researchers, postdocs and PhD students. Key topics for the business sector concern AI, energy, big data and ethics (see keywords). Ethical and trust issues in emerging technologies are also a key topic of policies addressing <i>Civil society</i> as a whole. <i>Established researchers</i>, another frequent target group, play an important role in biotechnology and nanotechnology flagship initiatives, as these are recurrent initiative keywords. The topics of AI and societal challenges appear more frequently in initiatives targeting <i>Postdocs and other early-career researchers</i> and <i>PhD students</i>. Policies targeting <i>Entrepreneurs</i> often concern AI and big data, but also climate change.","By large, <i>National strategies, agendas and plans</i> are the most recurrent instrument reported in this policy area (<b>Figure 3</b>). These are frequently used in policies reported under the <i>Artificial intelligence</i> theme. Keywords also often cite ethics and trust issues, digital technologies, energy and training as frequent topics. The remainder of the figure displays various kinds of instruments that are less frequently used. Some include <i>Networking and collaborative platforms</i> structured around topics such as big data, digital technologies such as AI and the internet of things while often focusing on start-ups and biotechnology (see keywords). The industrial revolution is another recurrent topic. Similar topics appear in policies using <i>Project grants for public research</i>. The keywords also suggest that various instruments address ethical concerns in emerging technologies, such as <i>Formal consultation of stakeholders or experts</i>, <i>Emerging technology regulation</i> and <i>Regulatory oversight and ethical advice bodies</i>.","Initiatives within the <b>Emerging trends in STI</b> policy area reporting budget data are more numerous within the <i>1M-5M</i> and <i>5M-20M</i> EUR yearly expenditures (<b>Figure 4</b>). There is little meaningful variation in the keywords across the figure's different budget ranges. Artificial intelligence, the theme with the largest number of policies, is a recurrent keyword across all budget ranges. This includes several national strategies that do not report any budget, shown as <i>Not applicable</i> in the figure. As it is the case in several other policy areas, initiatives with <i>More than 500M</i> EUR yearly budget expenditure address global challenges such as climate change and sustainable development.","<b>Figure 5</b> shows that the <i>United States</i> has reported the largest number of initiatives in this policy area, followed by the <i>European Union</i>, the <i>United Kingdom</i> and <i>Germany</i>. The chart shows only the number of policy initiatives reported by countries and gives no indication of their scale or scope. The figure should therefore be interpreted with care.
